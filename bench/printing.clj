;; printing — a PRINT-PATH stress test. The suite otherwise has no print axis,
;; so the per-item work the printers do between values (resolving the dynamic
;; vars that steer them) never showed up in a measurement.
;;
;; Three regimes, all of which reach the printer once per VALUE rather than once
;; per call, so per-item overhead dominates:
;;   - pr-str over scalars: hits *print-readably* per string/char
;;   - print-str into a rebound *out*: hits the *out* lookup per write
;;   - pr-str over namespaced maps: hits *print-namespace-maps* per map
;;   - format: a directive parse plus a number rendering per item
;;
;; Portable Clojure (jolt + JVM Clojure).
