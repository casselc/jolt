# Build phase breakdown — where does `jolt build` spend its time?
#
# bench/startup-phases.sh attributes a program RUN to its phases; this does the
# same for a BUILD, which has a completely different shape. A build's cost splits
# in two, and the two halves want unrelated fixes:
#
#   jolt's own passes : parsing each app source (several times over), the
#                       whole-program inference fixpoint, and per-form emit.
#                       Scales with the app's source size.
#   Chez's compile    : compile-file over the flat runtime+app Scheme, then
#                       make-boot-file and the stub link. The runtime half of
#                       that file is the same ~1.7 MB for every app a given jolt
#                       builds, so most of this is a FIXED cost per build.
#
# Optimizing the wrong half is easy without the split: an app with little source
# is dominated by the fixed Chez compile, a large one by the passes. So measure,
# then decide.
#
# The phases come from the build itself (JOLT_BUILD_PROFILE=1, build.ss), not
# from external subtraction — each is the real elapsed time between two points in
# one build, so they sum to the whole.
#
#   bench/build-phases.sh ../examples/ring-app app.core
#   REPS=3 bench/build-phases.sh ../examples/hiccup-app app.core
#   JOLT_BIN=target/release/jolt bench/build-phases.sh ../examples/ring-app app.core
#
# Every configuration is built from scratch (fresh -o path) so no phase is
# reading another run's artifact. Best-of-REPS per configuration, since a build
# does enough I/O to pick up scheduler noise; run it on an otherwise idle machine
# — a concurrent rebuild or test run makes these numbers meaningless.
#
# jolt must be a BUILT binary, not the dev bin/jolt source launcher: the dev
# script boots from source and compiles jolt.main every time, which lands in the
# startup phase and swamps the comparison.
