;; byte-arrays — RAW BYTES crossing the host boundary in bulk: block copies
;; between byte arrays, draining a stream into a reusable buffer, and the
;; String<->byte[] round trip. Per-pass work is dominated by moves of whole
;; regions, not by per-element arithmetic, which is what separates this from
;; `arrays` (indexed reads/writes on a ^doubles array).
;;
;; The axis is the BACKING a byte array holds. A jolt array is a Chez vector plus
;; an element-kind tag, and a ^bytes array's backing is a bytevector — the same
;; shape of thing the host's own I/O, string and ffi primitives take — so every
;; crossing here is a block move (bytevector-copy!, get-bytevector-n!,
;; utf8->string) instead of an element loop with a sign fold per byte. Nothing
;; else in the suite touches a byte array at all, and the paths below are exactly
;; where that shows: against v0.8.2, the last release in which a byte array was a
;; boxed vector of small integers, this whole bench runs 49x faster (13150.9ms ->
;; 270.6ms through ci/bench-gate.sh; the per-phase split is in README.md).
;;
;; The element-access phase is here for the two halves of a hinted ^bytes access:
;; (aget ^bytes a i) lowers to the direct backing read (jolt-vaget, skipping the
;; generic nth dispatch walk) and (aset ^bytes a i v) to jolt-baset, which owns
;; the narrowing to signed 8 bits that a byte store has to do. The fill line also
;; carries (byte v), a checked cast that lowers to jolt-byte-cast rather than
;; going through a var. A codegen round that moves any of the three lands here.
;;
;; No unhinted twin: the generic (aget a i) / (aset a i v) dispatch walk is already
;; covered by `arrays-unhinted`, and it is the same walk for every element kind.
;; What this bench adds over that pair is the BULK path, which no hint reaches.
;;
;; Portable Clojure (jolt + JVM Clojure) — System/arraycopy, ByteArrayInputStream
;; and String/getBytes are the same operations on both, and the JVM's arraycopy is
;; an intrinsic, so that column is close to the machine's memcpy.
