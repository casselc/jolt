# ffi-load-failure smoke (issue #1127): a native library that is ON DISK but
# fails to load — because a library IT depends on is missing — was reported as
# "not found — tried [libssl-3-x64.dll]" plus "(a task may build it)", with the
# file sitting right beside jolt.exe. The loader's own reason was thrown away.
#
# The fixture is a library linked against a second one, with the second
# deleted: the first is there, and cannot load. Every report path has to name
# the file it found and not call it missing, and a genuinely absent candidate
# has to keep reading as not found (and, from a task, as buildable).
