;; outright once two loads could overlap: both threads read the old set and the
;; second store dropped the first's symbol, so a
;; namespace that HAD loaded read as unloaded and ran its top level again on the
;; next require — the very bug the load protocol below exists to stop, reached
;; through the other table.
;;
;; A LOAD MUST NEVER ACQUIRE stm-lock. jolt-sync holds stm-lock across the whole
;; body of a transaction (refs.ss), so (dosync (require 'x)) is inside require while
;; holding it — and if that require parks in step 2, condition-wait releases
;; ldr-load-mu and NOTHING else, so it sits there holding stm-lock until the load it
;; is waiting for completes. A loading thread that then needed stm-lock could not
;; complete, and the two would wait on each other forever:
;;
;;   stm-lock -> ns_load   the parked dosync cannot release stm-lock until the load
;;                         it is waiting for finishes
;;   ns_load  -> stm-lock  the loader cannot finish without stm-lock
;;
;; That is not hypothetical. It reproduces on the rollback path, where a failed load
;; re-takes this lock to unmark before releasing its claim, and in the window between
;; claiming a namespace and marking it. So the mark goes through a leaf mutex of our
;; own that no transaction ever waits on, and the edge ns_load -> stm-lock does not
;; exist.
;;
;; NOT through the ambient transaction's log when there is one, which is what this
;; did first. It looks like the better answer — transactional, and it takes no lock
;; at all — and it is wrong twice, because the mark is not the transaction's to own.
;; A load either happened or it did not, and the file's defs are in the image either
;; way; an abort that rolls the mark back leaves loaded-ns marked and *loaded-libs*
;; not, which reads as unloaded and re-runs the whole namespace. And a buffered write
;; is invisible to ns-dedup-loaded? until commit, so
;; (dosync (require 'x) (require 'x)) ran x's top level twice.
;;
;; What the direct write leaves open is a mark landing while a user transaction that
;; also writes *loaded-libs* is committing, which costs that namespace one extra
;; reload. Narrow, one-directional, and the alternatives are a hang or the two bugs
;; above.
;;
;; Call with NO loader mutex held either. A (dosync (require ...)) reaches ldr-tbl-mu

;; later load takes that instead of re-reading the source, and that directory has to
;; be on the classpath for the load side to find it (core.clj's docstring says so
;; outright). jolt keeps the shape and swaps two substrate details: the artifact is
;; a Chez fasl of the emitted Scheme — what the AOT cache above already produces —
;; rather than .class files, and the load side searches the source roots, which are
;; jolt's classpath.
;;
;;   <dir>/<ns-rel>.so     the fasl; published last, so its presence is the signal
;;   <dir>/<ns-rel>.scm    the emitted Scheme it was compiled from
;;   <dir>/<ns-rel>.meta   what it was compiled against (below)
;;
;; RT.load picks a .class over a .clj on mtime alone. A fasl is much less forgiving
;; than a class file — one emitted by a different jolt calls runtime helpers that
;; may not exist any more — so .meta pins the jolt version and the runtime
;; fingerprint, and a mismatch means the artifact is ignored rather than loaded in
;; hope. Staleness against the source is a content hash, not an mtime: same intent
;; as the JVM's comparison, immune to a bare touch, and the same rule the AOT cache
;; decides by. Like the JVM this does NOT walk the whole dependency graph — .meta
;; records the direct requires and their source hashes, so editing a namespace this
;; one requires invalidates it, but a change further down does not. Recompile

;; --- the load protocol (concurrent require) ---------------------------------
;; Two threads requiring one namespace at once both used to pass the loaded-ns
;; check and both run its top-level forms, double-running every def and side
;; effect in the file. The mark-before-load below terminates a require CYCLE, but
;; only re-entry on ONE thread — to another thread the mark just says "loaded"
;; while the namespace is still half-built, which is worse than no dedup at all.
;;
;; This is JLS 12.4.2, the JVM's class-initialization procedure, over namespaces
;; instead of classes. It is the design that fits: initialization here is
;; dynamic, re-entrant, and allowed to be cyclic, which is exactly the shape the
;; JLS procedure exists for. Its step 3 IS jolt's existing mark-before-load
;; semantics, so nothing that works today changes; step 2 is the part that was
;; missing. The steps, and where each one lives:
;;
;;   1. acquire the lock                          -> ldr-load-mu
;;   2. in progress by ANOTHER thread: release,   -> condition-wait, then re-loop
;;      block until notified, repeat
;;   3. in progress by THIS thread: release and   -> 'recursive (a require cycle;
;;      complete normally (recursive request)        the caller sees a partially
;;                                                   loaded ns, as on the JVM)
;;   4. already initialized: release, return      -> 'loaded
;;   6. record in-progress-by-this-thread,        -> 'claimed, and the load then
;;      release, and initialize WITHOUT the lock     runs unlocked
;;  11. on success acquire, mark done, NOTIFY ALL -> ldr-end-load!
;;  12. on failure jolt rolls the mark back so a  -> the guard in load-namespace*
;;      retry can load, where the JVM marks the      (Clojure's behavior, and the
;;      class permanently erroneous                  file's existing behavior)
;;
;; Per namespace and not one global lock, so unrelated namespaces load in parallel
;; and a load that blocks only blocks threads wanting THAT namespace. Clojure went
;; the other way — serialized-require is (locking RT/REQUIRE_LOCK (apply require
;; args)) — but it is private and its own docstring calls it an "Interim function",
;; and it serializes every load in the process. Go avoids the question entirely
;; (package init is one goroutine, sequential, one package at a time, and import
;; cycles are a compile error); none of that is available here.
;;
;; Loading in parallel means COMPILING in parallel, which the compiler had to be
;; made safe for first: its emit-session scratch (the per-def cache cells and the
;; hoisted constant pool) lived on one process-global unit and was swapped in and
;; out around each def, so two threads emitting at once traded collectors and a
;; namespace that compiled cleanly alone died with "variable _kc$81 is not bound".
;; Those are thread-bound vars in backend_scheme now, the analyzer's position box is
;; per compilation, and its gensym counter reads and bumps in one swap!. See
;; test/chez/concurrent-require.clj, which loads distinct namespaces in parallel for
;; exactly this reason.
;;
;; The JVM's own hazard is that two threads entering a genuine require cycle from
;; opposite ends deadlock — spec-conformant, and OpenJDK closed JDK-8037567 and
;; two earlier reports as won't fix. We do not have to inherit the hang: the
;; owner of each in-flight load is already recorded, so ldr-wait-cycle walks the
;; wait-for graph and we raise instead. That changes nothing for a program that
;; works today; it only turns an undiagnosable hang into an error that names both
;; namespaces and both threads.
;;
;; Ownership is by EXECUTION CONTEXT — the fiber when a fiber is loading, the
;; thread id otherwise (ldr-load-ctx) — which is what makes step 3 a cycle break
;; rather than a self-deadlock, and it survives a park: a fiber is pinned to its
;; carrier for life (R0(d)), so a load that parks resumes as the same context and
;; load-namespace* deliberately keeps the claim across the park rather than
;; treating the escape as an exit.
;;
;; A load CAN park. (require 'x) from a go block on the :fiber backend, where x's
;; top level does a blocking channel op, is the shape, and it is the only way one
;; context ever observes another's claim on one carrier — same-carrier fibers do
;; not run concurrently. Everyone else wanting x then waits in step 2 until the
;; fiber comes back and finishes, which is the right answer and better than the
;; pre-protocol behaviour (they read the mark-before-load and returned with x
;; half-built).
;;
;; Thread id alone was not enough for that, because two fibers on one carrier share
;; one: a sibling fiber read the parked load's claim as its own, took step 3, and
;; returned with x half-loaded and no error. Nor is it enough to make a sibling
;; wait, because the wait itself has to be a PARK — a condition-wait would block the
;; carrier the parked load needs in order to finish. ldr-wait-for-load! picks the
;; mechanism from the waiter, and the cycle walk keys on the context, so two fibers
;; deadlocking over each other's loads is reported like any other cycle instead of
;; hanging.
;;
;; One behaviour improves as a side effect: :reload-all over a require cycle used
;; to recurse forever, because it turns the dedup off for the whole extent and
;; the mark was then no longer a stopping condition. Step 3 stops it.
;;
;; WHAT IS ACTUALLY PROVED, and what each proof rests on. Every transition below
;; happens under ldr-load-mu, which is what makes single-step reasoning sound: no
;; other thread can change ldr-loading or ldr-waiting between a check and the write
;; that follows it.
;;
;;   Mutual exclusion   pc = in-body implies you own the claim. Inductive over every
;;                      transition (claim, wait, recursive, end, escape, re-enter).
;;                      This is why ldr-assert-claim! refuses re-entry instead of
;;                      re-taking the claim: re-taking it is a single step that
;;                      breaks the invariant, putting two threads in one load body.
;;   No lost wakeup     a blocked waiter always has an owner left to wake it. Rests
;;                      on the wait committing before the lock drops — condition-wait
;;                      releases ldr-load-mu atomically with blocking, and a fiber
;;                      registers itself and sets its own state to 'parked while the
;;                      lock is still held (its SWITCH is outside the lock, which is
;;                      a separate matter and jolt-lock-wait's; what this property
;;                      needs is the commit, not the switch) — so no ldr-end-load!
;;                      fits between the owner check and the wait, and on
;;                      ldr-end-load! broadcasting
;;                      AND resuming from dynamic-wind's after thunk, which runs on
;;                      every exit. The LOADER's own park is not an exit and is
;;                      skipped there, which keeps the property rather than weakening
;;                      it: the owner is still recorded, still the same context, and
;;                      still on its way back to finish the load and wake everyone.
;;   Cycle detection    ldr-wait-cycle fires on exactly the waits that would
;;                      deadlock: it never misses a cycle and never raises on a
;;                      graph that would still have made progress. Rests on the
;;                      wait-for graph being FUNCTIONAL (one namespace per blocked
;;                      context, one owner per namespace) and on the pre-state being
;;                      acyclic, which holds because every earlier wait was checked.
;;   No deadlock        the lock graph is acyclic, and the edge that is hardest to
;;                      see is the one a park used to add: a fiber parked inside this
;;                      critical section left a blocking re-acquire of ldr-load-mu on
;;                      its resume, which runs in the scheduler and puts every fiber
;;                      on that carrier behind it. That edge is gone rather than
;;                      argued about — the switch happens with the lock released, and
;;                      locks.ss checks it at both switch points (jolt-04ee). The one
;;                      edge that is not the loader's to remove is stm-lock -> the load a parked
;;                      transaction is waiting for, because jolt-sync holds
;;                      stm-lock across a whole dosync body. So no load may acquire
;;                      stm-lock — see ldr-libs-update!, where that cycle was real
;;                      and hung.

;; --- who a load belongs to ---------------------------------------------------

;; carrier share one. Fiber A's load parks; fiber B on the same carrier requires the
;; same namespace, reads A's claim as its own, takes step 3 and returns with the
;; namespace half-loaded, silently. A fiber is the finer identity and it is the right
;; one: step 3 asks "am I already inside this load", and the answer is per execution,
;; not per OS thread. It is only ever compared and used as a table key, never
;; dereferenced, so nothing here depends on the fiber record's shape.
;;
;; Same-carrier fibers never run concurrently, so B can only ever observe A's claim

;; Wait for the load of `name` to end. Runs inside jolt-lock-wait's decision, so

;; park that jolt-lock-wait will perform once it has released the lock. A wakeup is
;; "something changed", never "the namespace is yours", either way.
;;
;; A fiber must not use the condition variable. condition-wait blocks the CARRIER
;; thread, and the load it is waiting for is very likely parked on that same carrier
;; (see above), so blocking there is a deadlock, and even when the owner is on
;; another thread it stalls every unrelated fiber the carrier is running. It parks
;; instead, and ldr-end-load! resumes it.
;;
;; NO WAKEUP IS LOST, and the reason is the registration and the 'parked commit both
;; happening under ldr-load-mu, which ldr-end-load! must take: a release either lands
;; before them and is seen by the re-check, or after them and finds a fiber to resume.
;; The SWITCH is the one part that happens outside the lock (jolt-04ee). It used to
;; happen right here, inside the critical section, leaning on jolt-with-mutex being a
;; dynamic-wind to release the lock on the way out and re-acquire it on the resume.
;; That is not safe, for the reason host/chez/locks.ss now states as a rule: the
;; re-acquire runs from Chez's rewind, on the carrier thread, at the interrupt depth
;; the fiber parked at, and the carrier can do nothing else until it succeeds — so the
;; park attaches a blocking acquire to a point in the scheduler, and every fiber on
;; that carrier is behind it. Every fiber and thread requiring any namespace passes

;; hold here any more than it held for the object monitor (jolt-3a87, jolt-dfuo).
