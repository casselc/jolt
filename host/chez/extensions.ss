;; Extension points: a named contract letting core declare functionality whose
;; DATA it does not carry, and a library supply that data later.
;;
;; A point declares the type of its key, the type of its value (:fields), a TOTAL
;; :default, and what an unregistered key means (:fallback). A provider registers
;; a possibly PARTIAL value at a key; lookup is (merge default provider), so a
;; provider states only what differs, and an older provider stays valid when the
;; schema grows through refine-extension!.
;;
;;   (register-extension-point! :currency-data
;;     {:key :string :root ""
;;      :fields {:symbol :string :frac-digits :long}
;;      :default {:symbol "¤" :frac-digits 2}
;;      :fallback :strict})
;;   (register-extension! :currency-data "de" {:symbol "€"})
;;   (extension-value :currency-data "de")   ; => {:symbol "€" :frac-digits 2}
;;
;; :fallback :strict is the reason this exists rather than a map with a default.
;; It says the default answers the :root key and nothing else, so an unregistered
;; key RAISES naming the point and the key instead of quietly handing back a
;; default that is wrong for it. That is what lets core ship a point it cannot
;; populate — formatting a German amount with US separators is a silent wrong
;; answer, and refusing is the correct answer to an unanswerable question.
;;
;; Every mutation bumps extension-epoch-n. Resolution tiers above tier 3 (a plain
;; lookup) cache per call site and guard on that epoch, so a library required
;; after a site warmed up invalidates it — the same shape as jolt-proto-epoch.

;; ext-operations-mu covers every MUTATION here: the declare's
;; check-then-create, refine's read-modify-write of the fields/default,
;; register's provider write, and the epoch bump.  It is an execution-context
;; logical mutex, not a counted Chez mutex.  Parsing, equality, map operations,
;; rendering, and errors can all reach user code or park; they therefore run
;; with zero counted locks while the logical owner continues to serialize the
;; complete semantic operation across threads and fibers.
;;
;; Two things break without it, and they are the two the protocol registry and the
;; multimethod epoch broke in the same way. The declare is check-then-create, so
;; two threads declaring one point each build their own providers table and a
;; provider registered through one is invisible through the other. And the epoch
;; is a `set!` read-modify-write, so a lost bump leaves a warmed call site's cached
;; resolution never invalidated — the exact staleness the epoch exists to prevent.
;;
;; Reads stay unlocked. extension-points-tbl and each providers table are STRONG
;; hashtables read single-key, which is safe for the reasons set out at var-table,
;; and jolt-extension-value is the hot path this whole epoch scheme exists to keep
;; cheap.
