# no-external-programs smoke: the runtime answers about its own process without
# running a program from PATH.
#
# jolt is meant to run with nothing installed beyond git for git deps (jolt
# issue #988). (System/getenv) as a map, the environment a ProcessBuilder seeds
# its child with, and the os.version property used to come from subprocesses:
# `env -0` and `sw_vers` / `uname -r`, spawned through /bin/sh. With an empty
# PATH the shell finds none of them, so the map came back empty, a child got an
# empty environment, and os.version was nil; on Windows, where the shell is
# cmd.exe, `env` is not a command at all. Each answer is read through the C
# runtime now (environ, sysctl, uname(2)), so it must hold with PATH empty.
#
# sh itself is still reachable by absolute path, which is what keeps the
# ProcessBuilder spawn below working: the test is about programs found on PATH.
