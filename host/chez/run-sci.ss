;; run-sci.ss — SCI conformance: load borkdude/sci's own source (vendor/sci) through
;; jolt and require its forms to compile+eval. A real-world Clojure-compatibility
;; stress test. Floor-gated like the corpus: a regression below the floor (or the
;; count today, 412/424) fails. Raise the floor as host gaps close.
;;
;; The tail is this gate's own load-order, not a host gap. load-order below is a
;; CURATED SUBSET in a fixed sequence, so a reference across it can land before its
;; target is loaded — SCI's real requires are transitive and cyclic, and jolt has no
;; trouble with them: the scifunctional gate loads the same library through the
;; ordinary dependency path and passes. Of the twelve: seven cannot resolve an
;; unqualified name from a namespace this list omits (four of them copy-core-var,
;; from sci.impl.copy-vars) and five name the namespace outright —
;; sci.impl.interpreter twice, sci.impl.types, sci.impl.cljs, edamame.impl.parser.
;;
;; That second group is why the floor moved 416 -> 412 (jolt-z88). A qualified name
;; whose namespace is not loaded used to compile to a class static, so the form
;; "loaded" and only a call would have found out; the analyzer reports it now, and
;; four forms moved from silently-latent to counted. Nothing about SCI or jolt
;; changed with them — the same four could never have run.

;; and *assert* so vendored SCI code that (set! *warn-on-reflection* true) finds a
;; thread-local slot instead of throwing "Can't change/establish root binding".
;;
;; A #_ discard or a reader conditional with no matching branch (SCI's .cljc has
;; plenty of `#?(:cljs …)`) reads as rdr-eof with the position ADVANCED — "no
;; form here", not end of input. Keying the loop on that marker alone stopped the
;; read at the first one, silently dropping the rest of the file: utils.cljc gave
;; up 13 forms in, so its allowed-loop/allowed-recur never got defined and every
;; later file referring to them failed. Branch on `j` like load-jolt-file and
;; ei-read-all do, and stop only when the position doesn't move.
