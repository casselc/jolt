;; run-trace-emit.ss — trace-r4: the emitter emits NO ring save/restore at all.
;;
;; R3 paired a save/restore around every non-tail call that could reach a jolt fn
;; prologue, so a returned subproblem's ribs stopped showing up in a later
;; backtrace (trace-smoke.sh's app.stale). That wrapper sat in
;; emit-invoke-maybe-clone, DOWNSTREAM of every branch of emit-invoke — so it also
;; wrapped the branches that lower to a single Chez primitive and can never enter
;; a jolt fn prologue at all:
;;
;;   (aget ^doubles a ^long i)  ->  (flvector-ref (jolt-array-vec a) i)
;;
;; became
;;
;;   (let ((_tu$ (jolt-trace-save)))
;;     (let ((_tr$ (flvector-ref (jolt-array-vec a) i))) (jolt-trace-unwind! _tu$) _tr$))
;;
;; — two procedure calls and a let-bound flonum around one machine instruction. The
;; let binding was the expensive half: holding a flonum across a call forces it onto
;; the heap, so the whole surrounding unboxed fl+ chain re-boxes. Measured 19x on a
;; (dotimes [i n] (aset b i (+ (aget a i) 0.5))) loop, and 4.5-8.6x across every
;; phase of a real image pipeline, against ~3% for the ring push itself. The
;; `:leaf?` registry fact and `leaf!` existed only to keep that wrapper off the
;; primitive sites.
;;
;; trace-r4 deletes the wrapper outright: the reporter reads the non-tail spine
;; off the LIVE CONTINUATION and takes only the current rib's TCO-erased tail
;; frames from the ring (source-registry.ss jolt-backtrace-string), so the
;; save/restore paid a call per call site for a read nobody does. Nothing emits
;; jolt-trace-save or jolt-trace-unwind! any more — every case below asserts the
;; negation. What survives is pinned too: the inline primitive lowerings, the
;; #|L<line>|# position markers, and the tracing-off behaviour.
