;; gate-boot-fresh.ss — the staleness predicate for the gate boot image.
;;
;; Split out of gate-boot.ss (which loads it, then acts on it) so it can be
;; loaded and exercised on its own, without booting a runtime: this predicate
;; deciding "fresh" when it isn't would mean a gate silently testing code that is
;; no longer on disk, the one genuinely dangerous failure mode of the boot cache.
;; test/chez/gateboot-smoke.sh drives it over synthetic input lists.
;;
;; SO is fresh when it exists and every input listed in INPUTS still has the
;; CONTENT it had when the image was built. Each line is "<hash> <path>".
;; Anything unclear — no image, no list, a listed file deleted, a line in the old
;; bare-path format — is NOT fresh, so the caller falls back to source.
;;
;; The comparison was mtime: is the image newer than every input. That is not the
;; question. It answers "was the image written after this file was last touched",
;; and the two come apart exactly when a build overlaps an edit — the compiler
;; reads a file at T0, the edit lands at T1, the image is written at T2 > T1, and
;; the image is forever "newer than" a file whose content it does not contain.
;; Editing while a gate runs is ordinary, and the result was a gate testing code
;; that is no longer on disk. It cost a session: `make test` went red on a state
;; image row while CI passed on identical sources, and the image was the only
;; difference. A false GREEN is the same mechanism with the arguments swapped,
;; and that one says nothing at all.
;;
;; Content answers the real question and cannot be fooled by clock order, a
;; preserved mtime (cp -p, tar -x, rsync --times), or a checkout that restores an
;; older revision. It costs ~17ms over the ~5.4MB of a full preamble against a
;; ~220ms cached boot, which is the cache still being worth having.
;; Standalone script: self-load the runtime adapter for sa-file-mtime-ms. A
;; second load by gate-boot.ss is a harmless redefinition.

;; FNV-1a 32-bit over the file's BYTES. Bytes, not characters: an input can be
;; any encoding, and decoding one as text to hash it would raise on the first
;; file that is not. The writer of the input list uses THIS function, by loading
;; this file, so the two can never drift apart.
