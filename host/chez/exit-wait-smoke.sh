# once every live non-daemon thread has finished, as a JVM running clojure.main
# does. Every expected outcome here was measured on JVM Clojure 1.12.5 / JDK 21
# with the same program (timing probes, 2026-09): what gets printed, the exit
# status, and whether the process is still up a few seconds later.
#
# The JVM's idle holds are long — a future's pool worker lingers 60s, a send's
# never ends — so those cases do not wait them out: they check the process is
# still alive after LINGER seconds and kill it. Everything else must end on its
# own well inside CAP.
