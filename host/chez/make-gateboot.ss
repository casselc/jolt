;; make-gateboot.ss — precompile the gate boot preamble to target/dev/gate.so.
;;
;;   chez --script host/chez/make-gateboot.ss
;;
;; The twenty run-*.ss pass gates (infer, wp, pic, narrow, …) each spend ~1.3s of
;; their ~1.5s runtime loading the same six runtime files from Chez source via
;; run-gate-harness.ss. This precompiles that preamble once so each gate boots in
;; ~0.2s instead — the same trick `make devboot` plays for bin/jolt.
;;
;; It cannot reuse target/dev/flat.so: that image also loads loader.ss, which
;; turns `require` into real file loading, and the gates deliberately stop at
;; compile-eval.ss so their alias-only `require` keeps working (see loader.ss's
;; header). Hence a second, smaller artifact.
;;
;; The emitted preamble is bld-runtime-manifest's prefix through 'compile-eval —
;; taken from the manifest rather than hand-listed, so the cache cannot drift
;; from the runtime. run-gate-harness.ss's literal fallback loads are pinned
;; against the same prefix by manifest-check.sh.
;;
;; Two-phase like make-devboot: emit gate.ss, then compile it in a FRESH Chez so
;; `error` and the other primitives the runtime shadows bind to the kernel
;; versions during compile-file.
