# error-report-check.sh — golden-file gate over what jolt PRINTS when it fails.
#
# Every other gate asserts that a bad program is rejected. None of them asserts
# anything about the report the user then reads, so the report has been free to
# drift: a message can name the wrong cause, a position can disagree with itself,
# and a trace can fill with reader internals without a single gate noticing. This
# pins the whole rendered report — message, position, ex-data, trace and exit
# status — for a set of representative failures, so a change to any of it lands
# as a reviewable diff instead of silently.
#
# Layout, one directory per case:
#
#   test/errors/<group>/<case>/input.clj   a program, run as `jolt <that path>`
#   test/errors/<group>/<case>/expr        an expression, run as `jolt -e <it>`
#   test/errors/<group>/<case>/argv        a whole argv line, run as `jolt <it>`
#   test/errors/<group>/<case>/output.txt  the expected report
#
# A case supplies exactly one of input.clj, expr and argv. argv is the escape
# hatch for anything the first two cannot spell — how a path is written on the
# command line (which the report echoes back), a subcommand, a flag — and its
# contents are word-split, so it is for fixed arguments, not for quoting games.
#
# The expected file ends with an "exit: N" line, so a case that stops failing (or
# starts) shows up as a diff rather than as identical empty output.
#
# Regenerate after an intended change:
#
#   sh host/chez/error-report-check.sh generate
#
# and read the diff before committing it — the whole point of the gate is that
# these files only change deliberately.
#
# Determinism. Reports name paths and line numbers, and most of those are
# incidental to the case:
#
#   - The case's own file:line IS the thing under test and is kept verbatim.
#     Cases run from the repo root with a repo-relative argv path, so the report
#     names test/errors/... on every machine. The one exception is the leading
#     directory: bin/jolt cd's to the repo root and so reports the case by its
#     ABSOLUTE path, where the built binary reports the relative one. That is the
#     launcher's choice, not the reporter's, and pinning it would make the gate
#     answer "which driver ran" instead of "what does the report say" — so an
#     absolute case path is rewritten back to the relative form. Everything after
#     the prefix, "././" included, survives.
#   - A frame inside jolt's own sources (jolt-core/, host/, stdlib/) has its line
#     number replaced with LINE. Otherwise every unrelated edit to main.clj would
#     rewrite golden files across the suite, which is how a gate stops being read.
#   - An absolute repo path, the home directory, and a temp directory are
#     rewritten to <root>, ~ and <tmp>. None should appear at all; they are
#     normalized rather than trusted not to.
#
# JOLT_BIN selects the jolt under test, and unlike the other gates it defaults to
# the BUILT binary rather than bin/jolt. The two drivers genuinely disagree about
# what a report says — the source-mode driver has jolt-core registered, so its
# trace reads "jolt.main/cmd-run (jolt-core/jolt/main.clj:343)" where the built
# binary shows a bare "cmd-run" — and normalizing that away would make the gate
# stop seeing the trace it exists to pin. The built binary is what users run, so
# the golden files record what IT prints, and a run needs `make testbin` first.
#
# (Those launcher frames should not be in a user-facing trace at ALL; they are
# the same plumbing noise as the reader's rdr-* frames. That is jolt-vy5i, and
# when it is fixed these golden files change — which is the point of pinning.)
