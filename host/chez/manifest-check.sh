# bootstrap.ss (the seed rebuilder's reduced set). cli.ss can't iterate a data
# manifest instead — loading the runtime through a for-each loop changes the
# visibility of the loaded files' top-level defines (verified: a loop-loaded
# runtime fails to compile), so the literal mirror stays and this guard makes any
# drift between it and the manifest fail loudly. bootstrap.ss takes its seed
# prelude/image as CLI args and needs no png/loader/ffi, so its fixed loads are
