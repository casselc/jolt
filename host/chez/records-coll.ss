;; ---- extend the collection dispatchers with a jrec arm ----------------------
;; Equality with a jrec on either side is clojure.lang.Util/equiv, step for step:
;; the LEFT side's equiv when it is an IPersistentCollection, else the right
;; side's, else the left side's equals.
;;   - a deftype's equiv is the one it declares (core.cache's caches equiv to
;;     their backing map, so (= cache {…}) holds); a defrecord's is field-wise
;;     jrec=? against the same record type, so a record is never = a plain map.
;;   - a jolt collection's equiv against a jrec: a sequential one compares
;;     element-wise with a type that declares clojure.lang.Sequential (the JVM's
;;     `instanceof Sequential` test, which is why (= [2 3] (eduction (map inc)
;;     [1 2])) holds in either order); a map or set never equals one. It does NOT
;;     ask the jrec's equiv: (= {:a 1} cache) is false on the JVM.
;;   - equals is the declared Object.equals (core.logic's LVar keys its
;;     substitutions on id, ignoring metadata, so structural jrec=? would be
;;     wrong), a defrecord's field-wise compare, or IDENTITY — two equal-field
;;     plain deftypes are not =, and neither are two that declare only Sequential.
;;
;; Two jrecs are answered from jolt=2 ahead of the arm walk (values.ss): this arm
;; registers first, so it was the LAST one asked, and every record compare paid
;; every other arm's predicate before reaching it. The jrec pair is in
;; eq-fast-probes, so no arm may claim one; this arm owns the MIXED pairs, which
;; still walk so a library arm for the other side's type is asked first.
;;
;; What a type contributes is read from its derived-interface vector (IA/IB
;; below, #f for a side that is not a jrec): slot 12 is #(equiv equals ipc?
;; list? map? set?),
;; slot 5 its declared Sequential, slot 3 whether it is a defrecord — where the
