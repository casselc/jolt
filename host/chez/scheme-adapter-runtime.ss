;; scheme-adapter-runtime.ss — the RUNTIME half of the portable-scheme-layer
;; adapter (PSL R3, epic jolt-867l).
;;
;; host/scheme-adapter/chez.ss is the gate-time half (assert-only, zero
;; definitions). THIS file is the part that actually runs: it owns the system-
;; tier FORBIDDEN names (blocklist tier "system") and exposes them to the rest
;; of the host only through named capability entry points. A non-Chez target
;; implements (or explicitly degrades) this one small surface instead of
;; chasing call sites; the portability gate's allowlist for this file IS the
;; sanctioned inventory of direct forbidden-name use.
;;
;; Every entry point is a transparent one-liner over the native — cp0 sees
;; through it within the flat runtime compilation unit, so there is zero
;; runtime cost and behavior is identical to the direct call. Each doc line
;; states the contract a target must meet and the degradation it may take
;; (derived from what the callers actually tolerate — see .dirge/specs/
;; psl-r3-system-tier.md for the per-site tolerance table).
;;
;; Loaded FIRST in bld-runtime-manifest (before rt.ss) so the sa-* names are
;; bound before rt.ss's own top level and the java/*.ss files it loads run —
;; rt.ss:51 and process.ss:338 are MACROS that resolve sa-os-family at
;; expansion time. PSL R5+R6 pinned this order; the R3 comment claiming
;; "second, after rt.ss" is obsolete.
;; NO (import (chezscheme)) here: this file is INLINED into the flat runtime
;; (bld-runtime-manifest, and again via rt.ss's own load) — a mid-program
;; import re-exposes Chez's error/warning bindings over rt.ss's %chez-error
;; shadowing and turned compile warnings fatal in standalone `jolt build`
;; (the bare-directory smoke caught it). Runtime files never import; the
;; top level already sees (chezscheme), including under chez --script.

;; ---- fibers R1: coroutines tier (capability: coroutines) --------------------
;; The fiber primitive + single-carrier scheduler (fibers epic, R1 jolt-nvpr.2).
;; The entry points are defined in fibers.ss, NOT here — this load is what makes
;; them visible to the gate-time adaptercheck (which loads ONLY this file) and to
;; every runtime loader. rt.ss loads fibers.ss again in the usual place; the
;; duplicate define is the harmless re-define pattern this file already relies on
;; (rt.ss:35 loads this file, and the flat build inlines both). fibers.ss is
;; self-contained — it uses only Chez natives, so loading it here, before the
;; value layer, is safe.

;; The dynamic-wind chain, for the scheduler's park path. NOT contract names:
;; these are Chez internals the fiber switch needs and no other target has to
;; supply — fibers.ss degrades to "change nothing" when sa-winder-in answers #f
;; for everything, which is what a target without them gets.
;;
;; They live HERE rather than in fibers.ss because $primitive access is the
;; adapter's job: fibers.ss is not target-owned, so the portability gate makes
;; it route through this file.
;;
;; Chez models the chain as a list of records — `winder` for dynamic-wind, with
;; fields #(in out attachments), and `critical-winder` for parameterize and
;; friends. The rtd is not exported, so it is recovered by building one winder
;; and reading its type back.

;; swish reads it from there (erlang.ss:792, current-disable-count) rather than
;; deriving it.
;;
;; Deriving it is what fibers.ss used to do — (disable-interrupts) returns the
;; new count, so a disable/enable pair answers the question — and the pair is
;; NOT equivalent to a read. It momentarily re-enables, and an enable that
;; brings the count to 0 is a delivery point for anything deferred while
;; interrupts were off. That put a delivery point inside jolt-fiber-park!, on
;; the far side of jolt-park-drop-finallys! and with the fiber already committed
;; to leaving: a Chez timer handler runs at disable-count 0 (probed, not
;; assumed), so the preempt handler's own park measured from 0 and the pair
;; enabled right back to it. A read cannot deliver anything. It is also about
;; cheaper, which matters because the scheduler does this on every switch.
;;
;; #3% and not #%, which is swish's spelling too. The safe entry point resolves
;; the field NAME at run time and costs 10 ns, twice what the disable/enable pair
;; it replaces costs; the unsafe one compiles to the field access and costs 2 ns.
;; What #3% gives up is argument checking, and both arguments here are literal.

;; locks.ss first: fibers.ss uses the counting lock wrapper, and jolt-with-mutex
;; is a macro, so it must be defined before this load rather than captured at
;; run time the way the sa-* seams are.
