# The babashka shape: a file with a shebang, marked executable, run as `./tool`
# or as `jolt tool`, with no extension and no project. Everything the script
# needs from the CLI is asserted here — the shebang line being read as a comment,
# *command-line-args*, *file*, stdin left readable, exit-code propagation, and a
# project's paths being on the roots when there is a project — plus which of a
# FILE, a builtin command and a task wins when a name could be more than one.

# Note that bin/jolt cd's to its own checkout, so a project-relative script path
# only resolves through JOLT_PWD: this gate runs every case that way on purpose.
