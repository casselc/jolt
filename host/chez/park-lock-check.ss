;; park-lock-check.ss — no fiber may leave the CPU while its carrier holds a
;; counted lock, checked as a SHAPE before it can run.
;;
;; THE RULE, which host/chez/locks.ss states and both switch points enforce:
;;
;;   a fiber never leaves the CPU while its carrier holds a counted lock.
;;
;; The runtime check (jolt-locks-assert-none!) is sound and complete for parks
;; that HAPPEN — it sees a park one call away, or inside user code the lock never
;; wrote, because it reads the lock count at the switch. What it cannot do is see
;; a park that nothing exercises. jolt-04ee was exactly that: loader.ss parked a
;; waiting fiber inside ldr-load-mu for two releases, and the window needed
;; concurrent requires of one namespace from several fibers and threads at once,
;; so it sat there reported-but-unreproduced. This check is the half that does not
;; need the window. It reads the code.
;;
;; WHAT IT DOES. Every handwritten host .ss file is read AS DATA (comments and
;; strings cannot lie that way, and the previous mechanism was grep). Then:
;;
;;   1. build the call graph over host definitions — every symbol in OPERATOR
;;      position in each definition's body, with quote bodies, binding names and
;;      case datums walked past so a local named like a primitive is not a call to
;;      it.
;;   2. close "can park" over that graph from the two switch points and their
;;      wrappers, to a fixpoint. So a helper that parks is a parker, and so is
;;      anything that calls the helper, however deep.
;;   3. report every call to a parker that is lexically inside a jolt-with-mutex
;;      body, naming the file, the enclosing definition and the callee.
;;
;; Step 2 is the whole value: the lexical scan this replaces found NOTHING in the
;; pre-fix loader, because ldr-begin-load!'s region called ldr-wait-for-load! and
;; the park was in there. One level of indirection was enough to hide it.
;;
;; TWO KINDS OF FINDING, because the two hazards are found two different ways and
;; mixing them made the check useless before it made it wrong:
;;
;;   park       a call, at any depth in the call graph, to one of the runtime's own
;;              park primitives. This is jolt-04ee, and the transitive closure is
;;              what sees it.
;;   user-code  jolt-invoke named directly inside the region: the lock hands
;;              control to code it did not write, and that code may park anywhere.
;;              Three bugs in this family were exactly that (jolt-3a87 the object
;;              monitor, jolt-232k the delay, jolt-pb2s the transaction).
;;
;; user-code is deliberately LEXICAL and not closed over the call graph, which was
;; tried first and reported 27 sites across nine files. The reason is not that the
;; long chains are false — (swap! …) under the atom lock reaches jolt= reaches a
;; record's user-defined equality — it is that "calls something that can eventually
;; call user code" is true of most of the runtime, so closing over it produces a
;; list nobody can act on and an allowlist that hides the two entries that matter.
;; Named directly in the region, it is a decision somebody made at that spot.
;;
;; WHAT IT DOES NOT DO, stated rather than left to be discovered:
;;
;;   - a lock held by HAND (jolt-lock! … jolt-unlock!) is not a region it can
;;     read, because whether the unlock precedes the park is a question about
;;     control flow, not about nesting. The channel ops (java/fibers-async.ss) are
;;     that shape on purpose — they hold the channel mutex by hand precisely so
;;     they can release it before parking — and a scan that guessed would either
;;     accuse them or learn nothing. Those sites are the runtime check's.
;;   - a park through a value rather than a name — a hook, a var, a record field
;;     holding a procedure — is invisible here. Also the runtime check's.
;;
;; So neither half is sufficient and the pair is: this one rejects the shape
;; before it runs, and the other one catches what a static reading cannot see.
;;
;; It also checks its own teeth. If jolt-locks-assert-none! ever stops being
;; called from a switch point, the runtime half is gone and every gate still
;; passes — so the switch points are checked BY NAME for that call, and losing it
;; fails here.
;;
;;   sh host/chez/park-lock-check.sh          check against the allowlist
;;   sh host/chez/park-lock-check.sh --regen  regenerate it (review the diff!)
