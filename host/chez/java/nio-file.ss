;; nio-file.ss — java.nio.file shim, part 1: the Path value + Paths / Path / of
;; construction, FileSystems path construction and glob/regex matching, and the
;; File<->Path bridge. babashka.fs is built entirely on java.nio.file, so this
;; is the substrate it runs on.
;;
;; A Path is a jhost tagged "nio-path" whose state is the path string,
;; normalized as the JDK's path parsers do at construction: runs of separators
;; collapse and a trailing one is dropped, and on Windows it is held with "/" and
;; rendered with "\" (java/io.ss jolt-path-normalize, path-native). Like
;; java.nio.file, a Path is just a name until an operation touches disk —
;; resolution against the working directory happens in toAbsolutePath / the Files
;; layer, not at construction.
;;
;; Loaded from rt.ss after java/io.ss (needs make-jfile / jfile? / jfile-abs).

;; Files' member alists, collected in REVERSE and flattened once at the bottom.
;; Eleven chunks are appended over the file; growing the accumulation with
;; (append files-accum chunk) copied everything gathered so far each time. The
;; flush restores source order, which matters: the dedup below is last-wins.

;; ---- path string algebra ----------------------------------------------------
;; A Path is a name, and a name has a ROOT: a prefix that is not a segment and
;; must be reproduced verbatim. POSIX has one ("/"); Windows has "C:/" (drive),
;; "//srv/sh/" (UNC), "/" (rooted on the process's current drive) and "C:"
;; (rooted on that drive's current directory). This file assumed the POSIX shape
;; everywhere — the root was one leading "/" and nothing else — so on Windows a
;; drive path was a RELATIVE path whose first segment happened to be "C:".
;; (fs/absolute? "C:/Windows/System32") answered false, getRoot answered nil,
;; getParent walked off the drive letter and normalize could fold a path above
;; its own root (jolt-lang/jolt#1074).
;;
;; java/io.ss already owns this split for getCanonicalPath — path-root,
;; path-segments and path-rebuild, with the platform a parameter so
;; win-path-test.ss can pin the Windows rows from a Linux runner — so the Path
;; shim asks IT rather than keeping a second, POSIX-only answer. Two hand-kept
;; copies is how java.io and java.nio.file start disagreeing about a path, which
;; is the same reason the access(2) predicate there is one function for all six
;; of its callers.

;; ---- error reporting: java.nio.file's exception family, not java.io's -------
;; Chez's filesystem primitives raise &i/o-filename conditions. Left to escape,
;; they reach jolt through host-faults' generic fallback, which names them with
;; java.io classes -- FileNotFoundException for a missing path -- and renders the
;; Chez primitive's own message. java.nio.file.Files answers a different family,
;; per UnixException.translateToIOException, so every Files entry point that
;; touches the filesystem translates its own failure here.
;;
;; Two facts about the raise shape this:
;;
;;   - Only open-file-input-port / open-file-output-port attach the R6RS
;;     subconditions (&i/o-file-already-exists, &i/o-file-does-not-exist,
;;     &i/o-file-protection). mkdir, rename-file and directory-list raise a bare
;;     &i/o-filename whose only clue to the errno is the strerror text sitting in
;;     the irritants.
;;   - Reading a class off that text would tie it to libc's wording, and to the
;;     locale the process happens to run under.
;;
;; So the entry points needing a class Chez does not type stat first and name the
;; error themselves. That is a race for the error's NAME only, never for
;; correctness: no pre-check here gates a mutation. createFile -- the one place
;; where losing the race would cost data -- takes the O_EXCL open instead, which
;; does raise a typed condition, and stats nothing.
;; A message names the path AS THE CALLER GAVE IT, as the JDK's does: Files ops
;; resolve a relative path against user.dir before touching disk (nfp), and the
;; message used that resolved string, so (Files/delete (Paths/get "nope/x"))
;; reported "/home/me/proj/nope/x" where the JDK says "nope/x". The helpers

;; competing offsets a real host has st_dev's high half, st_nlink, or st_uid,
;; none of which reach 0x4000 for a root directory). Measured on both Linux
;; ABIs -- natively on x86-64, and under qemu-aarch64 on a statically linked
;; aarch64 build -- where stat("/") is mode 040755 and exactly one row matches:
;;

;; the discrimination working rather than a coincidence to rely on.
;;
;; Identity gets the first word and measurement gets the last. The proposal is
;; preferred whenever the measurement agrees with it, so a host we already know
;; reads exactly as it did before; a proposal the measurement CONTRADICTS is
;; discarded rather than used, because a contradicted proposal is a proposal
;; that would read garbage -- which is the whole failure this guard exists to
;; prevent, and throwing is what it did about it before. That is also the
;; property that makes a NEW row cheap to add: get the offsets wrong and nothing
;; verifies, so the host refuses exactly as it refuses today rather than quietly
;; answering nonsense. A row still has to be measured before it is added -- this
;; is a backstop, not a licence to guess.
;;
;; Only when nothing can be measured (no stat entry, no root directory) does
;; identity stand alone, which is the pre-#798 behaviour. Only macos/linux are
;; measured at all: a Windows _stat is a different struct that none of these rows
