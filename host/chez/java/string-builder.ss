;; string-builder.ss — java.lang.StringBuilder and StringBuffer over the jhost
;; record: the builder every (StringBuilder.) in core and the stdlib constructs
;; (pprint's column writer, cl-format, with-out-str's sink), its method table,
;; and the count / seq / str / class / instance? arms that make a builder a
;; CharSequence. Shared by every target; the emitter's proven-StringBuilder
;; fast path (backend_scheme.clj sb-direct-emit) calls sb-append! / sb-str /
;; sb-length / render-piece directly, so their bodies and the method table's
;; are one definition.
;;
;; Needs the jhost record, register-class-ctor! / register-host-methods!, the
;; value-model arm registries (records / records-interop / host-class) and
;; throw-jvm; loads after those and before anything that constructs a builder.

;; ---- StringBuilder ----------------------------------------------------------
;; state: #(materialised-string pending-chunks-reversed pending-length).
;;
;; Appends accumulate as a list of chunks and are joined only when something
;; reads the buffer. The obvious representation — one string, appended to with
;; string-append — copies the whole buffer on every append, which makes building
;; an n-char string O(n^2). That is not theoretical: clojure.data.json reads a
;; quoted string a character at a time into a StringBuilder, so one 88KB JSON
;; string value cost 623ms to parse against 30ms for the same bytes spread over
;; many short values. See test/chez/string-builder-perf.ss.
;;
;; Every other method still reads through sb-str, so it flushes first and
;; behaves exactly as before; only append and the two size reads skip the join.
