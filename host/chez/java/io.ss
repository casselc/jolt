;; java.io.File + host file I/O, implemented over Chez's filesystem
;; primitives. A File is a
;; path-backed jfile record: (instance? java.io.File f) is true, str/slurp coerce
;; it to its path, and the File method surface (getName/getPath/exists/
;; isDirectory/isFile/listFiles) dispatches through record-method-dispatch.
;;
;; Provides make-file/file?/slurp/spit/flush/dir?/
;; list-dir for the overlay file-seq (20-coll.clj), which calls __file?/__dir?/
;; __list-dir + the .isDirectory/.listFiles/.isFile method surface.
;;
;; Loaded LAST in rt.ss, after
;; dot-forms.ss (so the jfile method arm wraps the fully-built dispatch) and
;; natives-meta.ss / records.ss / printing.ss (jolt-type / instance-check /
;; jolt-str-render-one, which it extends).

;; FileSystem.normalize(): runs of "/" collapse to one and a trailing "/" is
;; dropped. "." and ".." are left alone -- the JVM's constructor does not resolve
;; those, and neither does this. new File("/a/b//c").getPath() is "/a/b/c".
;;
;; Every path the ONE-argument constructor produces is normalized, and so is
;; every path built by as-file, the file: URL coercion, createTempFile,
;; getParentFile and listRoots -- nine construction sites of which only one is
;; the constructor entry point. So make-jfile normalizes and they all go through
;; it, rather than the invariant being restated nine times.
;;
;; The two-argument constructor normalizes each ARGUMENT and then resolves them.
;; That result is normal too, on every JDK from 21. See jolt-file-join.
;; Scanning starts after the ROOT, whose separators are structural rather than
;; redundant: "//srv/sh" is a UNC root and collapsing its leading pair to
;; "/srv/sh" names a directory on the current drive instead. POSIX has no root
;; to protect (FROM is 0 there), so "//a/b" still folds to "/a/b" as the JVM
;; does — the row win-path-test.ss already pins.

;; not express: it rejoined every segment as "/" + segment, so on Windows a
;; drive-absolute path came back as "/C:/Users/x/a.txt" — a path resolved
;; against the CURRENT drive, so reading or writing the canonicalized value
;; failed as "C:/C:/Users/x/…" (jolt-lang/jolt#991).
;;
;; The platform is a parameter rather than a call to sa-os-family so the Windows
;; rows are gated from a POSIX host (test/chez/win-path-test.ss) — the Windows
;; build is exactly where realpath is missing and this fallback is the whole of
;; getCanonicalPath.

;; Is C a separator for this platform? POSIX has one; "\" is an ordinary
;; filename character there and must stay one. Windows accepts either, and the
;; fallback receives either — a File built from "C:\Users\x\a.txt" reached
;; jfile-fold-dots as a single unsplittable segment.

;; --- why an open failure is classified, and where ----------------------------
;; The JVM raises java.io.FileNotFoundException when a path cannot be opened, and
;; libraries branch on that class: instaparse decides whether its argument is a
;; grammar or a file by slurping and catching FNF. A raw Chez i/o condition is
;; not catchable as that class -- nor as any Java class -- so the caller's
;; fallback never runs. The message is the JVM's shape: the path AS GIVEN, then
;; the reason in parens. The JVM uses this one class for all the reasons, so only
;; the parenthetical distinguishes them.
;;
;; This lives in io.ss rather than next to the stream constructors because slurp
;; reaches a file through read-file-bytes-on-disk below, not through
;; io-streams.ss -- and while that was the only opener NOT classifying, slurp of
;; a directory, of an unreadable file and of anything at all under descriptor
;; exhaustion all came back as a bare java.io.IOException carrying Chez's own
;; wording (jolt-3ah).
;;
;; --- the reason comes from the condition, not from a second look at the disk ---
;; What the JVM puts in the parentheses is strerror(errno), and Chez's i/o
;; conditions carry that very string among their IRRITANTS, as
;; ("/the/path" "No such file or directory") -- and equally "Permission denied",
;; "Is a directory", "Too many open files". Both sides are printing the same libc
;; string, so the condition is what is asked.
;;
;; A probe of the filesystem cannot stand in for it. EMFILE is the case that
;; shows why: the open failed because the PROCESS is out of descriptors and
;; nothing is wrong with the path at all, so a probe finds a readable file and
;; blames the program's own leak on the file's mode bits. A parent directory
;; without +x is the same story inverted -- the open says "Permission denied" and
;; the probe cannot so much as stat the target, so it would say "No such file or
;; directory". And whatever the reason, the filesystem can change between the
;; failure and the probe.
;;
;; The IRRITANTS, not condition/report-string: Chez's EMFILE condition carries no
;; i/o-file-name, so report-string raises trying to format it -- and it raises
;; whether or not descriptors are still exhausted, so there is no waiting it out.
;; The reason is the LAST irritant; the first is the path Chez was handed, which
;; is not always the path being reported (spit opens a temp file and names its
;; target), so position picks it out rather than identity.

;;                 = c              when c is absolute and p is "/"

;;                 = p + "/" + c    otherwise
;;
;; So a parent that already ends in "/" does not produce a doubled slash (ring's
;; resource middleware builds "assets/" + "index.html"), a duplicate INSIDE
;; either argument collapses, and a separator-only child yields the parent alone.
;;
;; A null parent is the child by itself. An EMPTY parent is not: it resolves
;; against getDefaultParent(), which is "/" -- new File("", "c") is "/c", not
;; "c", and new File("", "") is "/", not "". Both measured against the JVM.
;;
;; Worth knowing before measuring this yourself: resolve grew its c == "/" case
;; in JDK 21. Through JDK 20, new File("/a/b", "/") answered "/a/b/" -- a path
;; carrying a trailing separator no one-argument constructor can produce, whose
;; .getName() was "". From 21 on it is "/a/b", which is what this matches.
;;
;; A null CHILD is not a null parent: the constructor null-checks it up front and
;; throws, message and all -- new File("/a", null) raises NPE rather than
;; answering "/a". jolt read it as "" and quietly answered the parent, the same
;; silently-wrong-file shape as the nil coercions above.

;; The rules above, spelled for both platforms. Three things in them are really
;; questions about the platform rather than about "/":
;; whether a character is a separator, whether the parent already ends in one,
;; and which one a join should add. The old spelling asked (string=? p "/"),
;; which is "is the parent the root" written for the one platform that has
;; exactly one root — Windows has "C:/", "//srv/sh/" and "/". Since a normalized
;; path ends in a separator only when it IS a root, asking that directly covers
;; every root on both platforms and needs no root table.
;;
;; The default parent stays "/" for both: WinNTFileSystem.getDefaultParent() is
;; "\\", which is the same path in the "/" spelling this shim renders with.

;; Callers lean on that: validation that only tries (URI. s) and catches, and
;; anything downstream that trusts getHost to be a host (jolt-oov, #904).
;;
;; The shape mirrors the JVM's parser closely enough to reproduce its messages
;; ("Illegal character in authority at index 11: …"), including the three rules
;; that are easy to miss:
;;   - a registry-based authority is legal but has NO host: "http://h_c.com/p"
;;     parses and getHost is nil, because "_" is not a hostname character. Same
;;     for a non-ASCII host and for a port that is not all digits.
;;   - a character above 0x80 that is neither a space nor an ISO control is
;;     legal UNESCAPED wherever an escape is, so "http://h.com/ä" is a valid URI.
;;   - an opaque URI ("mailto:a@b.com") has no path at all; its body is the
;;     scheme-specific part.

;;     the run decodes through utf8-bytes->string (natives-str.ss), which is that
;;     decoder: "%FF" is one U+FFFD and "%C0%AF" is two, where Chez's own

;; --- the component constructors (URI. scheme host path fragment) & kin -------
;; The JDK builds these the long way round: compose a URI STRING out of the
;; pieces, quoting each one against the character set its component allows, then
;; run the ordinary parser over the result. That is why they QUOTE where the
;; single-string ctor REJECTS — (URI. "https" "x.example" "/a b" nil) is
;; https://x.example/a%20b, while (URI. "https://x.example/a b") is a
;; URISyntaxException — and why the exception a bad component raises reports an
;; index into the composed string. Composing rather than filling the fields in
;; directly is what keeps the two paths from drifting: every URI jolt hands back
;; came out of one parser.
;;
;; Arities are the JDK's five: (s), (scheme ssp fragment),
;; (scheme host path fragment), (scheme authority path query fragment),
;; (scheme userInfo host port path query fragment). Anything else is
;; "No matching ctor found for class java.net.URI", which is the message JVM
;; Clojure's reflector gives for the same call (jolt#949).
