;; regex-anchors.ss — java.util.regex's line anchors as O(1) SRE primitives (#1062).
;;
;; Java's `^`, `$` and `\Z` are defined over a SIX-character terminator set (\n,
;; \r, \r\n, NEL, LS, PS), and `\r\n` is ONE terminator, so an anchor has to look
;; at the unit before the position as well as the one or two after it.  irregex has
;; no such assertion, so regex-translate.ss expressed each of them as an SRE built
;; from `look-ahead` and `look-behind` — correct, but every evaluation ran the
;; general look-around machinery, and a look-behind additionally wrapped the chunk
;; and re-entered the matcher.  #1062 measured `(re-find #"$" line)` at 70x the
;; JVM's cost for exactly that reason; bounding the look-behind rescan
;; (regex-anchor-sre.scm) removed the quadratic term but left the constant.
;;
;; Every one of those assertions is decidable from at most three code units — the
;; one before the position and the two after it — so each is written here as a
;; direct predicate and compiled by regex-anchor-sre.scm into a single zero-width
;; test.  The SREs they replace stay in regex-translate.ss and are registered below
;; as the primitives' `sre-named-definitions` expansions, so every OTHER irregex
;; walker (sre-length-ranges, sre->nfa, sre->cset) still sees the full semantics and
;; needs no teaching; only the matcher takes the short path.
;;
;; Loaded from regex.ss after irregex.scm (for sre-named-definitions and the
;; chunker accessors) and after regex-translate.ss (for the SREs and Java's
;; terminator characters).

;; The code unit K units past i, or #f when the input ends before it.  Walks the
;; chunker so a chunked source answers the same as a string; the k=0, in-chunk case
;; is every anchor's hot path and is read straight off the string.

;; written as a range cost ~26 ns, and #1062's per-line `\s`-anchored scans paid it
