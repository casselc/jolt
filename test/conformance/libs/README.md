# Library conformance: replaying third-party test suites on jolt

`make libconformance` runs real Clojure libraries' **own** `clojure.test` suites on
jolt and compares the tallies against the standings recorded in `manifest.edn`.

This is the outer ring of jolt's conformance testing. The corpus
(`test/chez/corpus.edn`) is the inner ring: small, portable, JVM-certified
expressions that run in `make ci` with no external checkout. Library suites catch
what the corpus cannot — the combinations, the load-order effects, and the
long-tail core functions a real library leans on — but they need the libraries
present, so they are opt-in.

## Running

```sh
make libconformance                          # every library in the manifest
make libconformance LIBS="malli honeysql"    # just these
```

The library checkouts are ordinary upstream clones (**not** vendored — see
`test/conformance/README.md`), expected at `../conformance-libraries` or wherever
`JOLT_CONFORMANCE_LIBS` points. First-party jolt libraries (`time`, `xml`, `db`, …)
are expected beside this repo, or at `JOLT_SIBLING_LIBS`. The gate skips cleanly
when the checkout is absent.

Per-library output is written to `target/libconformance/<name>.log`.

## What the manifest holds

One entry per library: how to put it on the classpath, and what it scored.

| key | meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `:name` | manifest key, and the `LIBS=` selector |
| `:root` | checkout-relative directory, when it differs from `:name` (e.g. `yamlstar/core`) |
| `:paths` | source + test roots, relative to the library root |
| `:test-paths` | which of those hold test namespaces (default `["test"]`) |
| `:deps` | extra roots: `@lib/...` another checkout, `~lib/...` a first-party jolt library, `/...` absolute |
| `:extra-deps` | ordinary deps.edn coordinates, for deps with no local checkout — jolt resolves the source out of the jar |
| `:nses` | explicit namespace list; omitted means "discover every namespace under `:test-paths` that defines tests" |
| `:exclude-nses` | namespaces to skip (benchmarks, JVM-only suites) |
| `:preload` | jolt-side namespaces to require before the suites — a shim registering a host class the library reaches for through interop |
| `:expect` | the recorded tally |
| `:timeout` | seconds before the child is killed (default 300) |
| `:skip` / `:note` | why a library is not run, or why a non-zero tally is expected |

## The gate criterion

A library **regresses** when `pass` drops or `fail` / `error` / `load-fail` rise
against `:expect`. A move the other way — `pass` up, or any of the other three
down — is reported as `BETTER` and does not fail the gate: improving a library is
then a one-line manifest edit.

`:tolerance` widens both verdicts on all four counters, not just `pass`: in a
generative suite whether a drawn case fails or errors moves run to run while the
total stays put. It is a **symmetric** noise band, so it suppresses `BETTER` just
as it suppresses `WORSE` — a `pass` above the recorded one but inside the band
reports `ok`, because re-recording it would only re-centre the band on whatever
the last run drew. test.check (`:tolerance 40`) reading pass=245 against a
recorded 236 is that case. Above the band the move is real and says so, and every
library without a `:tolerance` is pinned exactly, so any rise there is `BETTER`.

`:expect` is deliberately a tally and not a per-assertion baseline. Some suites
are order- and environment-sensitive (compliment completes against the live
runtime, for instance), so pinning individual assertions would be noise. What the
tally does catch is the thing worth catching: a jolt change that silently breaks
a library that used to work.

## When a library regresses

1. Read `target/libconformance/<name>.log` — the failing assertions are in the
   suite's own output.
2. Reduce it to the smallest expression that misbehaves, and check that expression
   against reference Clojure.
3. If jolt is wrong, **the fix comes with a jolt-side test**: a corpus row when the
   expression is a single portable form, otherwise a fixture under `test/chez/`
   wired into `make ci`. The library suite is the discovery mechanism, not the
   regression test — `make ci` must fail without the external checkout too.
4. If jolt is deliberately different, record it in
   `test/conformance/known-divergences.edn` and note it on the manifest entry.
