;; The path rules that read a platform rather than a filesystem, per platform:
;; the lexical half of java.io.File/getCanonicalPath (jolt-lang/jolt#991) and
;; the glob translator's separator class (jolt-lang/jolt#1086). Run:
;;   chez --script test/chez/win-path-test.ss
;;
;; realpath(3) is not bound on a Windows build, so THIS is the whole of
;; getCanonicalPath there — and its POSIX-only spelling rejoined every segment
;; as "/" + segment, so `(babashka.fs/canonicalize "C:/Users/x/a.txt")` answered
;; "/C:/Users/x/a.txt": a path rooted on the current drive, which every later
;; read or write resolved as "C:/C:/Users/x/…" and failed. Backslashes were
;; worse — no separator was recognized, so the whole path was one segment.
;;
;; The Windows rows are the reason the platform is a parameter: they are
;; unreachable from the host that runs CI, and the walk that re-attaches a
;; missing tail to its longest existing ancestor takes realpath as a parameter
;; too, so it is driven here from a table rather than from a filesystem.
