;; test/chez/concurrent-require.clj — two threads requiring one namespace.
;;
;; Nothing used to serialize load-namespace*, so both threads passed the
;; loaded-ns check and both ran the target's top-level forms, double-running
;; every def and side effect in it. Worse, the mark-before-load that terminates a
;; require CYCLE marks the namespace loaded BEFORE its forms run, so to a second
;; thread it read as fully loaded while it was still half-built — a require that
;; returns having defined nothing.
;;
;; The loader now follows JLS 12.4.2, the JVM's class-initialization procedure,
;; per namespace: in progress by another thread means block until notified, in
;; progress by this thread means complete normally (the cycle break, which is
;; what mark-before-load already did).
;;
;; Two properties, and the second is the one that mattered:
;;   A. the target's top level ran EXACTLY once, however many threads required it
;;   B. every thread, on return from its require, saw the LAST form in the file
;;
;; Then the other half of the question, which one namespace cannot ask: threads
;; requiring DIFFERENT namespaces at once. One shared target means only one load
;; ever runs, so it exercises none of what happens when two do. Loading distinct
;; namespaces in parallel broke two ways, and both are gated on this file now:
;;
;; The gate is per NAMESPACE, not one lock over every load: ldr-load-mu is held
;; only across the begin/end bookkeeping and the load itself runs unlocked, which
;; is the point of taking JLS 12.4.2 per namespace rather than Clojure's single
;; RT.REQUIRE_LOCK. So the threads below really are compiling at the same time,
;; and C and D are both live.
;;
;;   C. every require completes. The compiler's emit session used to live on one
;;      process-global unit, with emit-with-cells save/restoring its slots per
;;      def, so two threads emitting at once traded constant pools and a namespace
;;      that compiled fine alone died on "variable _kc$81 is not bound". The fix
;;      is not a lock: *cache-cells* and *const-pool* are thread-bound vars in
;;      backend_scheme now, so each thread's emit session is its own.
;;   D. every namespace is in *loaded-libs* afterwards. The loader used to conj
;;      the ref with a bare read-modify-write, so two threads finishing together
;;      dropped one of the two marks — and a namespace missing from *loaded-libs*
;;      reads as unloaded and runs its top level again on the next require, which
;;      is the bug A tests for, arriving through the other table. A separate probe
;;      lost 3 to 15 of 24 that way. Twelve loads finishing at once do overlap
;;      here, so this is the check for it and not a placeholder.
;;   E. two threads entering one require cycle from opposite ends report it instead
;;      of hanging, and one of them still completes. This is where the JVM gives up
;;      and deadlocks; the loader walks its wait-for graph before blocking.
;;   F. a (dosync (require ...)) that has to wait does not deadlock the loader. It
;;      parks holding stm-lock, so nothing a load does may ever need stm-lock back.
;;      Found by modelling the lock graph rather than by running anything: the cycle
;;      is stm-lock -> the load being waited on -> stm-lock, and it hung outright.
;;   G. a require inside a transaction dedups, and an aborted transaction does not
;;      un-load a namespace that really loaded. The mark is two tables and buffering
;;      one of them in the txn log split them apart in both directions.
;;   H. a load that PARKS finishes, and the namespace is whole afterwards for the
;;      fiber that loaded it and for a thread that waited on it. A park is a
;;      continuation escaping the load body, and treating it as an exit wedged the
;;      namespace marked-but-empty for the life of the process.
;;   I. a sibling FIBER on the carrier the parked load is on gets the whole
;;      namespace too. It shares the owner's thread id, so ownership by thread read
;;      the claim as its own and returned half-loaded; and it has to wait by parking,
;;      because blocking that carrier is the one thing the parked load cannot survive.
;;   J. a requiring-resolve INSIDE a load, while another thread's requiring-resolve
;;      is waiting on that load. Clojure's requiring-resolve holds RT/REQUIRE_LOCK
;;      across its require because its loader has no other guard; here the
;;      per-namespace claim already blocks the second thread until the first one's
;;      load finishes, so the process-wide lock adds nothing — and it adds an edge
;;      the wait-for graph cannot see. Thread A holds the lock and waits on the
;;      namespace B is loading; B's top level reaches for the lock. Neither is a
;;      loader wait, so the cycle walk never fires and both hang for good. jolt's
;;      requiring-resolve is a plain require for that reason, and this pins it.

;; Property I: a SIBLING FIBER on the carrier the parked load is on (jolt-n31).
;;
;; Two fibers on one carrier share a thread id, so keying load ownership by thread
;; read the parked load's claim as the sibling's own: it took step 3, the cycle
;; break, and returned with the namespace half-loaded and no error. Ownership is by
;; execution context now, so the sibling sees somebody else's claim and waits.
;;
;; And it has to wait by PARKING. The load it is waiting for is parked on the carrier
;; they share, so a condition-wait would block the one thread that can ever resume it
;; — the fix for the stale read would have been a hang. ldr-wait-for-load! picks the
;; mechanism from the waiter and ldr-end-load! resumes the parked ones.
;;
;; One carrier and two fibers requiring the same parking namespace, the second
;; spawned while the first is inside the load: the first claims and parks on its
;; channel, the carrier then runs the second, which finds the claim. Both must come
;; back with the namespace whole. A hang here fails by timeout, which is why the
;; derefs are bounded.
