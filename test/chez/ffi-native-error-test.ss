;; ffi-native-error-test.ss — atomic native-error capture gate for jolt.ffi.
;;
;; Specifies the {:capture-native-error true} contract for foreign-fn/defcfn
;; and the direct jolt.ffi/__cfn special form: a capture-enabled, non-void
;; binding returns [native-result error-code] (result first), where the error
;; code is the value Chez reads from the calling thread's native error slot
;; (POSIX errno / Windows GetLastError) in the foreign-call return path.
;;
;; Required discriminations covered:
;;   * POSIX errno and Windows GetLastError where supported (the captured code
;;     equals what the C helper wrote under the target's convention).
;;   * capture off vs on — same symbol, scalar vs paired return.
;;   * exact [native-result error-code] shape and ordering.
;;   * blocking + capture composition under an actual concurrent collection.
;;   * varargs + capture composition with the compound convention preserved.
;;   * lazy native symbol resolution (the .so may load after the def).
;;   * persistence after a later helper overwrites the same thread's slot.
;;   * scalar preserved for omitted / empty / legacy :blocking / false options.
;;   * analyzer fail-closed: capture on :void, and unknown / namespaced /
;;     non-keyword / non-Boolean / non-map / extra trailing options.
;;
;; Run via the wrapper, which compiles and preloads the C helper:
;;   sh test/chez/ffi-native-error-test.sh "$(CHEZ)"
;; (from the repo root, like every other gate).
;;
;; SEED DEPENDENCY: the capture suite compiles jolt.ffi/__cfn forms with
;; {:capture-native-error true}, so this gate requires a seed re-minted
;; (`make remint`) from an analyzer/backend that validate and lower the option
;; (analyze-ffi-fn in jolt-core/jolt/analyzer.clj, the
;; jolt-ffi-native-error-procedure lowering in backend_scheme.clj). Against an
;; older checked-in seed those forms fail at compile time with an unknown
;; options key — that failure is the seed lagging the source, not a runtime
;; regression.
;;
;; Setup definitions fail fast: if the production lowering is absent or cannot
;; compile, there is no meaningful native-call suite to continue. Individual
;; value assertions are guarded so one bad call reports FAIL without hiding the
;; remaining discriminations. The convention-selection claim is asserted by
;; matching the captured value against the helper-written code, not by branching
;; on the host.
