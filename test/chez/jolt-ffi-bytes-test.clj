;; jolt.ffi bulk byte-buffer gate — the foreign<->bytevector block moves
;; (sa-foreign-bytes-ref!/-set!) that read-array / read-into! / write-array /
;; read-bytes / write-bytes are built on. The property under test is that a

;; to signed-byte fold in both directions, and a byte that is not valid UTF-8
;; never reaches a decoder.
