;; test/chez/fibers-io-test.ss — R8 gate: transparent IO parking (sockets +
;; poller half, epic jolt-nvpr.8). Run: chez --script test/chez/fibers-io-test.ss
;; (wired into `make fibers` after the R5 pool gate).
;;
;; R8 (fibers-r8-io.md) delivers the JDK's trick: every blocking socket call with
;; a non-blocking OS equivalent uses the non-blocking one when called from a
;; fiber, and blocks the OS thread otherwise. Same user-facing code either way.
;; stdlib/jolt/socket.clj sets O_NONBLOCK on every fd it hands out; on EAGAIN it
;; asks jolt.io-poller to wait for readiness — parking the fiber (jolt.host
;; seams from fibers-async.ss) when there is a current fiber, and blocking in a
;; private kevent/epoll_wait on this thread when there is not. One poller thread
;; per process (kqueue on macOS, epoll on Linux), its blocking wait declared
;; :blocking (__collect_safe).
;;
;; Why this matters HERE more than on the JVM: a blocking call PINTS its carrier,
;; and since continuations cannot migrate (R0(d)), the fibers queued behind it
;; are stranded and adding carriers cannot rescue them. Gate 1 is the whole
;; round in one check; gate 3 is the collect-safety check — a poller whose wait
;; is not collect-safe stops the WHOLE PROCESS from collecting for as long as it
;; waits, which is nearly always.
;;
;; Gate checks (spec, in order; item 6 — file offload — is the other half of the
;; round and is NOT in scope here):
;;   1. a fiber reading a socket with no data available PARKS, and a sibling
;;      fiber on the SAME carrier makes progress while it waits — the whole
;;      round in one check (red without the R8 socket layer).
;;   2. the same code path on a plain OS thread still blocks and still works.
;;   3. a FULL COLLECT succeeds while the poller is blocked in kevent/
;;      epoll_wait (the __collect_safe check — asserted, not assumed).
;;   4. 8 fibers each doing a socket round trip concurrently on ONE carrier:
;;      all 8 park at once, then all 8 complete with their own payloads — real
;;      parking, not serialized blocking.
;;   5. accept parks too: a fiber blocked in accept resumes when a connection
;;      arrives.
;;   6. existing jolt.socket behaviour off a fiber is untouched: a thread-mode
;;      round trip + close semantics, unchanged (the full socket-test.clj suite
;;      keeps running under `make test` / smoke).
;;
;; The gate loads the REAL loader (gate-boot + loader.ss + ffi.ss, in cli.ss's
;; order) so `require 'jolt.socket` resolves the real stdlib stack with its
;; transitive requires — the same combination the production CLI has. Timing is
;; only ever a floor relative to an in-run delay (gate 2), never an absolute
;; ceiling — see the flake history note at the top of fibers-test.ss.
;;
;; Unlike the R1-R5 gates (which pin the pool to 1 for determinism and drive
;; everything through sa-fiber-run-all), this gate runs with the R4/R5 carrier
;; THREAD live (jolt-fiber-ensure-carrier!): the poller's wake resumes a parked
;; fiber by enqueueing it on its carrier, and only the live carrier loop will
;; pick it up. It never pumps sa-fiber-run-all once the carrier is live.
