;; aot-fingerprint-test.ss — the AOT cache's content hash and the two runtime
;; fingerprints built on it.
;;
;; The cache keys fasls on source content, and the generation directory keys on
;; the runtime that emitted them. Both used to fold in Chez's equal-hash, which
;; is NOT a content hash: it samples ~26 characters of a string no matter how
;; long the string is (first 6, ~15 strided, last 5). Length was doing all the
;; real invalidation work, so any length-preserving edit — 42→99, <→>, inc→dec,
;; an equal-length rename — kept the key and silently served the previous fasl.
;;
;; aot-cache-smoke.sh covers the per-namespace key end to end. This gate covers
;; the two things that file cannot reach cheaply: the hash's own byte coverage
;; (case a is the property everything else rests on — under equal-hash it fails
;; ~4000 times over), and the two runtime fingerprints, which otherwise need a
;; full jolt rebuild to exercise.

;; caught even by a sampling hash, so a fixture built that way passes without
;; the fix and proves nothing. Offset 1500 of ~3023 is outside every offset
;; equal-hash looks at, which is what makes this gate real.
