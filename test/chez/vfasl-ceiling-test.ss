;; vfasl-ceiling-test.ss — the boot image's LZ4 ceiling (jolt-lang/jolt#886).
;;
;; A compressed fasl entry big enough cannot be read back when the entry is LZ4:
;; c/new-io.c's S_bytevector_uncompress returns the length as `Sfixnum(r)` with
;; `int r`, and Sfixnum multiplies by 8 in the argument's own type, so the
;; product leaves 32 bits and c/fasl.c's length check can never match. A binary
;; whose boot image is over the line dies inside Sbuild_heap before a line of its
;; own code runs. gzip's arm of the same function hands zlib a uLong and has no
;; ceiling.
;;
;; WHERE the line falls is undefined behaviour and differs by platform: 2^28
;; where the widened product keeps its sign (the reporter's ta6le), 2^29 where
;; it does not (tarm64osx). jolt re-encodes at 2^28, at or below both, so this
;; gate measures the kernel in front of it rather than asserting one number.
;;
;; That only became reachable in 0.8.5, which ships the boot as vfasl: a plain
;; boot is one compressed entry per top-level form and its entries are kilobytes,
;; while vfasl-convert-file combines each input boot file into ONE entry — so the
;; app half of a large program is a single image that stops loading rather than
;; merely loading slowly.
;;
;; jolt cannot patch the kernel it links against, so build.ss measures the
;; converted boot and re-encodes over-ceiling images with gzip. This gate pins
;; what that fix rests on:
;;
;;   a. a ceiling still exists, and jolt's constant sits at or below it while
;;      staying high enough that everything under it loads — no ceiling found at
;;      all means a newer Chez fixed the overflow and the workaround can go
;;   b. gzip clears the size that defeated LZ4, so it is a valid answer
;;   c. the entry scanner reads real converted boots correctly, answers 0 for a
;;      boot with no LZ4 entries at all, and trips at exactly jolt's constant
;;   d. both fallbacks run: bld-vfasl-convert! in process, and bld-vfasl-ensure!
;;      for the paths that convert in a spawned Chez (build-with-cc,
;;      build-shared, and every cross build)
;;
;; (a) and (b) allocate bytevectors of the measured ceiling; the Makefile target
;; runs this with JOLT_MAX_HEAP=off so the runtime's own heap bound does not fire
;; first.

;; bit is the C compiler's business. Both manifestations are real, on Chez 10.4.1:
;;
;;   sign-extended   length comes back NEGATIVE at 2^28     ceiling 2^28
;;                   (ta6le, and the platform in jolt-lang/jolt#886 — its
;;                    -222298112 is exactly 314572800*8 wrapped to signed
;;                    32-bit and divided back by 8)
