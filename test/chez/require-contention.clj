;; test/chez/require-contention.clj — one namespace whose load PARKS, required at
;; once by many fibers across many carriers and by a real thread (jolt-04ee). Run
;; through jolt; wired into host/chez/smoke.sh, which caps every case.
;;
;; WHY THIS EXISTS, and why concurrent-require.clj was not already it.
;; concurrent-require.clj covers the parked load thoroughly (its properties H and I)
;; but pins the pool to ONE carrier, because what it is testing there is that two
;; fibers sharing a thread id do not read each other's claim. One carrier is the
;; configuration in which this file's hazard cannot happen: ldr-begin-load! used to
;; park a waiting fiber INSIDE the (jolt-with-mutex ldr-load-mu) region, and the
;; damage that does is a blocking re-acquire of that mutex attached to the fiber's
;; resume — which runs from Chez's rewind, on the carrier thread, at the interrupt
;; depth the fiber parked at, where the carrier can do nothing else until it
;; succeeds. Several carriers rewinding parked waiters at the same time is what makes
;; that reachable. The object monitor's version of the same shape wedged 8 runs in 12
;; at 8 carriers and 0 in 12 at 2 (jolt-dfuo), so the count is the teeth.
;;
;; WHAT IT ASSERTS. The load runs exactly once however many contexts asked for it
;; (the target counts its own loads with defonce + swap!), every asker returns, and
;; every asker sees the form AFTER the park — a namespace that is marked loaded but
;; half-built is the failure the load protocol exists to prevent, and it is silent.
;;
;; HOW IT FAILS NOW, which is the part worth having. Since the rule became a rule
;; (host/chez/locks.ss: a fiber never leaves the CPU while its carrier holds a
;; counted lock, checked at both switch points), a regression to the old shape does
;; not need the window at all: the first fiber that waits for a parked load raises,
;; the go block reports it, and this case fails deterministically instead of wedging
;; 1 run in 12. Verified in that direction by reverting the loader.
