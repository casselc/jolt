;; answering a string lets a path that cannot be opened travel on as though it
;; could (jolt#1094).
;;
;; Every expectation below, message text included, was read off JVM Clojure
;; 1.12 rather than chosen. The split the JVM draws is by errno: ENOENT,
;; ENOTDIR and EACCES answer best-effort; ELOOP and ENAMETOOLONG raise.
