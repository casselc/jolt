;; tz-offset-seconds sets TZ, calls tzset and reads tm_gmtoff. TZ is process
;; global, so without a restore the process is left in whichever zone was probed
;; last — and the capability check at boot ends on "UTC". Every jolt process then
;; answered UTC from localtime(), including user code calling it through jolt.ffi,
;; while the machine was somewhere else entirely.
