;; test/chez/async-io-thread-test.ss — the io-thread gate (jolt-579).
;; Run: chez --script test/chez/async-io-thread-test.ss (wired into `make fibers`,
;; because io-thread's carrier IS a fiber and this asserts that).
;;
;; core.async names three carriers and jolt now has all three, with no option to
;; set: `thread` is a real OS thread, `go` is the CPS pass on whatever
;; *go-backend* says, and `io-thread` — (thread-call f :io) — is a FIBER. What the
;; JVM buys with a virtual thread (a blocking-shaped body that is cheap to have
;; thousands of, and releases its carrier when it blocks on a channel) is what a
;; fiber is, so :io maps onto fibers and :compute / :mixed stay OS threads.
;;
;; Gate checks (in order):
;;   1. the result channel behaves like thread's: the value lands, a nil body
;;      just closes
;;   2. the carrier each name picks — io-thread body IS on a fiber, thread body is
;;      NOT — and neither honors *go-backend*: an io-thread inside
;;      (binding [*go-backend* :thread] …) is still a fiber, a thread inside
;;      :fiber is still a thread. A dispatcher here would make io-thread mean
;;      "a fiber unless someone above me said otherwise", which is not something
;;      a caller can use.
;;   3. the workload table: :io -> fiber, :mixed / :compute / no-arg -> thread,
;;      anything else throws instead of silently picking one
;;   4. a park SEVERAL FRAMES DEEP in the body, with no binding and no CPS pass:
;;      a fiber parks by capturing its continuation, so a blocking-shaped body
;;      parks from inside a called function — which is the whole point of having
;;      io-thread as well as go
;;   5. the check with teeth: N io-thread bodies parked AT THE SAME TIME on ONE
;;      carrier, all of them resuming. A body that held its carrier instead of
;;      parking would let exactly one of the N run, so this is what separates a
;;      fiber from the OS thread io-thread used to be an alias for. The park
;;      counter (jolt-fiber-chan-parks) is asserted to move by at least N, so
;;      "they all finished" cannot be satisfied by N bodies that never parked.
;;   6. a throwing body closes its channel and publishes to go-monitor, exactly
;;      as a thread-backed one does
;;   7. the spawner's dynamic bindings reach the body, and its transaction does
;;      not (the rule async-go-spawn-thread and jolt-fiber-go-spawn both enforce)
;;   8. every compiler-declared execution-transfer seam runs its body on a
;;      distinct execution context, never inline on the spawning caller
;;
;; ONE CARRIER for the whole file, pinned before the first spawn: it makes check 5
;; mean what it says, and it also means any body that pins its carrier hangs
;; everything after it rather than passing quietly on a machine with cores to
;; spare. Every wait in here is bounded in the JOLT code (alts!! against a
;; timeout, via iot-await) so that failure prints as a FAIL and not as a hung CI
;; job. Nothing in a body blocks the carrier by other means — no Thread/sleep, no
;; raw fd — because on one carrier that would strand the rest of the file, which
;; is the documented reason `thread` exists.
