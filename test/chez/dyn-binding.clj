;; test/chez/dyn-binding.clj — the dynamic-var binding gate (jolt-3bo).
;; Run through jolt (wired into host/chez/smoke.sh).
;;
;; WHY THIS EXISTS. A var read no longer walks the binding stack unless the var's
;; dyn-bound? flag says it has been bound at some point (Clojure's
;; Var.threadBound). That is only correct while one invariant holds: if a cell is
;; in any frame of this thread's stack, its flag is set. Break it and the var
;; silently reads its ROOT while a binding for it is in scope — no error, no
;; crash, just the wrong value, which is the worst shape a bug can have.
;;
;; The invariant is kept by routing every push through one helper. The hazard is
;; therefore a NEW push site that does not use it, and the sites most likely to
;; grow one are the two that never went through push-thread-bindings in the first
;; place: the loader's per-file vars and the agent's *agent*. They are checked
;; first, below, because the ordinary binding path would keep passing while they
;; broke.
;;
;; Each of the three push sites was sabotaged in turn to confirm this file
;; actually catches it — the loader's and the agent's fail on their own check, and
;; push-thread-bindings fails on the agent's, since agents convey through it.
;;
;; Semantics only, no timing: the cost is bench/dyn-binding (`make dynbench`), and
;; a timing assertion in a gate is how the concurrency scenarios in this same PR
;; ended up flaky on a loaded CI box.

;; ORDER MATTERS. The direct-push checks run FIRST, before anything below that
;; could set the flag for them by accident. with-bindings and bound-fn re-push the
;; map get-thread-bindings hands back, which contains every var bound at that
;; instant — including the loader's *file* — so running them first LAUNDERS the
;; flag onto those cells and a push site that forgot to set it still reads
;; correctly. Verified by sabotage: with the checks in the other order, removing
;; the flag from the loader's own push left this file passing.

;; --- the paths that push a frame DIRECTLY ------------------------------------
;; *agent* is bound by the agent machinery (java/concurrency.ss), not by
;; push-thread-bindings. If that push stops flagging the cell, *agent* reads its
;; root — nil — inside the action, and nothing else in this file notices.

;; *file* is bound by the loader around each file it loads (loader.ss), again by a
;; direct push. Reading it from a loaded file is the only way to see that frame.
;;
;; The (in-ns) afterwards is not decoration: load-file leaks the loaded file's
;; namespace into the caller (jolt-zjb), so without it every form BELOW this one
;; compiles inside dyn.probe.file and fails to resolve `failures`. Restore by hand
