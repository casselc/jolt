;; test/chez/fibers-test.ss — R1 gate for the fiber primitive + single-carrier
;; scheduler (epic jolt-nvpr.2). Run: chez --script test/chez/fibers-test.ss
;; (wired in as `make fibers`; detection-free, no jolt boot needed).
;;
;; Correctness: spawn/yield/resume round trip; a fiber that finishes; a fiber
;; that raises with the scheduler surviving and the other fibers still running;
;; N fibers round-robin in order; a fiber yielding from 40 frames down.
;;
;; And two properties that only show up with a second thread involved, both
;; deterministic rather than sampled (sections 7b and 7c): concurrent resumes of
;; one parked fiber put it on the run queue exactly once, and a fiber's
;; completion is published under the monitor mutex so its state and its error
;; can never be observed apart.
;;
;; Numbers as assertions with generous ceilings (pinned by R0's findings):
;;   spawn  < 5us     (measured 0.84us)
;;   switch: depth-independent (40 frames within 3x of 1) — the property,
;;            not the speed; two absolute forms flaked on CI, see below
;;   per-fiber live < 8KB (measured ~3.5KB)
;; Memory is measured the R0-corrected way: retain the fibers in a global,
;; force (collect (collect-maximum-generation)), read ABSOLUTE live bytes.
;; Per-phase bytes-allocated deltas produced both of R0's wrong findings and
;; are never used here. The switch bench raises the GC trip threshold for the
;; timed region so segment churn (3.5KB per park) does not pollute the number.

;; DEGRADES TO A NO-OP here. So a pass from this gate says nothing whatever
;; about the winder-drop path — jolt-park-drop-finallys! does not do anything in
;; this process, and could be arbitrarily broken without a single check moving.
;;
;; That is not hypothetical. A stack-truncation attempt (jolt-atc.3) was wrong
;; enough to kill every fiber under the full boot and this gate passed clean,
;; because the primitive it needed was absent and the call degraded to nothing.
;;
;; So the degradation is asserted rather than assumed. Two things follow: the
;; no-op path stays deliberately exercised (a target without these primitives
;; must still run fibers), and if fibers.ss ever gains a HARD dependency on the
;; adapter these checks fail loudly instead of the gate quietly covering less
;; than it appears to.
