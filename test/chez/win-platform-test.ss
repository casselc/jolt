;; The Windows-shaped answers a Linux runner can never observe
;; (jolt-lang/jolt#1074). Run:
;;   chez --script test/chez/win-platform-test.ss
;;
;; Every one of these shipped in v0.8.10 because nothing here was a parameter,
;; so each row was whichever one the CI host happened to be:
;;
;;   * path.separator answered ":" on Windows, where ":" is the drive suffix.
;;     (babashka.fs/split-paths "C:/a;C:/b") came back ["C" "/a;C" "/b"], so
;;     fs/exec-paths was garbage and fs/which never found anything.
;;   * ProcessBuilder split PATH on ":" too, treated only a leading "/" as
;;     absolute, and knew nothing of PATHEXT — so a bare "curl" and a
;;     drive-absolute "C:/Windows/System32/curl.exe" were both unresolvable and
;;     babashka.process threw before a spawn was attempted.
;;   * The java.nio.file Path shim had a POSIX-only root, so a drive path was a
;;     RELATIVE path whose first segment happened to be "C:": fs/absolute? said
;;     false, getRoot said nil, getParent walked off the drive letter and
;;     normalize could fold a path above its own root.
;;   * java.io.tmpdir read only TMPDIR, which Windows does not set, so every
;;     temp file went to "/tmp" on whichever drive the process was on.
;;   * File/listRoots answered "/" instead of enumerating the mounted drives.
;;   * spit staged into a temp file and renamed over the target, and Windows
;;     refuses a rename onto an existing destination — so the SECOND spit to any
;;     path failed. That one needs a real filesystem and is gated on the Windows
;;     runner (.github/workflows/tests.yml); what is pinned here is the POSIX
;;     half of the same helper, which must keep replacing without the delete.
;;
;; Like host-derived-props-test.ss and win-path-test.ss, the table is pinned over
;; the platform the run does NOT have: the *-for entry points exist for exactly
;; that, and the row that broke is only reachable from a host we do not gate on.

;; Everything above is a table. This is the part that would actually have caught
;; jolt-lang/jolt#1108: it starts a real child through the real ProcessBuilder, so
;; on the Windows runner it drives CreateProcessW end to end, and on a POSIX one
;; it drives posix_spawn. The failure it is written against is the one the issue
;; describes — a spawn that "succeeds" with exit 0 and an empty stdout — which no
;; assertion on the exit code alone can see.
;;
;; The windows-deps job runs `make winplatform` for exactly this reason: before
;; it, that job ran only `make depsunit mvnhttp`, and jolt.mvn-http initializes
;; its own Winsock and spawns nothing, so the broken paths were never touched.
