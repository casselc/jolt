;; test/chez/fibers-chan-test.ss — R3 gate: one waiter protocol for threads and
;; fibers (epic jolt-nvpr.4). Run: chez --script test/chez/fibers-chan-test.ss
;; (wired into `make fibers`).
;;
;; Loads the full host runtime (rt.ss), like fibers-state-test.ss: the gate
;; drives the REAL async.ss channels and the R1/R2 fibers at host level.
;;
;; The bet under test: fibers consume core.async's existing callback protocol.
;; A fiber's <! registers an alt-taker handler whose wake is the fiber; a
;; thread's pending op keeps the condvar wake. Channels are not rewritten — the
;; only channel-side change is that alt-deliver! dispatches the wake strategy.
;;
;; Gate scenarios (spec, in order):
;;   1. fiber -> thread handoff, unbuffered (fiber put parks; thread take wakes it)
;;   2. thread -> fiber handoff, unbuffered (fiber take parks; thread put wakes it)
;;   3. buffered handoff in both directions — immediate, no capture
;;   4. a take that finds a waiting putter — immediate, no capture
;;   5. a thread blocked on an empty channel wakes when a fiber puts
;;   5b. put! completes on the caller against a parked fiber taker
;;   6. N fibers and M threads on one channel, every value delivered exactly once
;;      (fiber-takers/thread-putters, and fiber-putters/thread-takers)
;;   7. a closed channel wakes both kinds of waiter
;;   8. no deadlock: a fiber parks on a channel while another fiber on the same
;;      carrier is putting (the notify pairing path)
;;   9. offer! completes against a parked fiber taker (the ac-try-give! clause)
;;  10. stress: a fiber drains a pumping thread, no lost wakeups (bounded)
;;
;; The R3 measurement is the capture counter jolt-fiber-chan-parks — the
;; immediate-completion path must not move it. Where timing appears it is a
;; RATIO against a calibration loop in this process, never an absolute ceiling.
