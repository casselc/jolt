;; fnform-test.ss — R1 (bead jolt-hqpn): unique anon-fn letrec names +
;; source-form registration. A user-ns anon literal must be registered under a
;; deterministic jfn$<ns>$<def>$<n> name, that name must be what Chez's
;; inspector reports for the live closure ((io 'code) 'name), and the registry
;; must carry {form, ns, free-names}. Covers a literal inside a map, a nested
;; literal, a variadic literal, a literal capturing a local ONLY through a
;; nested literal, and the shadow case (fn [x] (+ y (let [y 1] y))). A
;; clojure.core-produced closure (partial) must NOT be jfn$-named (system gate).
