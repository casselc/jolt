;; clojure.pprint dispatch-fn gate: simple-dispatch and code-dispatch must be
;; real multimethods on class so libraries can extend them. The driver is
;; core.logic's nominal namespace, which does
;;   (. clojure.pprint/simple-dispatch addMethod Tie pprint-tie)
;; and dies with "No matching method addMethod found for clojure.pprint$simple
;; _dispatch" while those vars are plain functions.
;;
;; Not a corpus row: it requires loading clojure.pprint and registering methods,
;; which the corpus runner never does. Runs through the real CLI like the
;; instant / cl-format suites; emits PPRINT-DISPATCH OK / FAIL for smoke.sh.
;;
;; The built-in arms are asserted against the exact strings the old plain-fn case
;; form produced (captured before this change). A defrecord still prints as a
;; bare map: pprint routes it through IPersistentMap, as it does on the JVM --
;; pr is the one that prints #ns.R{...}, so changing that here would be a
;; regression, not a fix.
;;
;; Order matters: the addMethod / defmethod tests below MUTATE the global
;; dispatch table (that is what they exist to test). On the unfixed code
;; (defmethod on a plain fn redefines the var as a fresh, near-empty
;; multimethod), so anything that reads simple-dispatch's table must run first.
;; The no-ambiguity check therefore leads, on the pristine dispatch; the
;; mutation tests come last.
