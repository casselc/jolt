;; test/chez/fibers-go-test.ss — R4 gate: `go` on fibers, and `alts!` as a
;; wait set (epic jolt-nvpr.5). Run: chez --script test/chez/fibers-go-test.ss
;; (wired into `make fibers`).
;;
;; R4 (fibers-r4-go.md) delivers two things:
;;   1. clojure.core.async/go on the fiber backend, opt-in via the dynamic var
;;      *go-backend* (:thread default, :fiber opt-in) read AT SPAWN TIME. The
;;      default stays byte-for-byte today's go (a real OS thread). Parking works
;;      ACROSS FUNCTION BOUNDARIES — a go body calling a function that calls a
;;      function that does <! — the headline capability. The carrier is exactly
;;      ONE OS thread (fibers.ss), started lazily on the first :fiber spawn,
;;      parked on a condition when the run queue is empty (never a spin). No
;;      carrier pool — that is R5.
;;   2. alts! as a WAIT SET: one handler registered across all ports, committing
;;      exactly once via alt-claim!; both waiter kinds wake (a thread waiter is
;;      signalled via the condvar, a fiber waiter is resumed); the immediate
;;      case stays immediate and allocation-free; a losing registration is
;;      PRUNED so a long-lived channel does not accumulate dead handlers.
;;
;; Sections 1-3 run real jolt code through the real compiler (gate-boot.ss =
;; full runtime + compile-eval): (binding [*go-backend* :fiber] (go ...)).
;; The alts! sections drive the HOST seam — jolt-async-do-alts, jolt-async-*,
;; async-chan-alt-takers — the same style as fibers-chan-test.ss. The gate boot
;; deliberately stops at compile-eval.ss (no loader), so the overlay names
;; (alts!, poll!) are brought in explicitly: the gate loads
;; stdlib/clojure/core/async.clj via load-string ONCE, up front — the same
;; host+overlay combination the production loader always has — including the
;; public opts translation that selects __do-alts's native default-aware arity.
;; The overlay is additive (it wraps host seams, never redefines a host
;; binding), so loading it first changes nothing for the host-seam sections. It
;; is also where `go` and `go-loop` are DEFINED — the host provides go-spawn and
;; nothing above it — so a gate that wants either must load it, as this one does.
;;
;; This file never pumps sa-fiber-run-all once the R4 carrier is live (a manual
;; pump would race the carrier over the shared queue).
;;
;; Gate scenarios (spec, in order):
;;   1. a :fiber go body runs to completion and its value lands on the channel
;;   2. parking through TWO NESTED CALLS (the differentiator vs the JVM's
;;      state-machine go), plus loop/recur, plus inside a dynamic-wind-carrying
;;      form (try/finally — R2: every park fires a handler pair, so the after
;;      thunk must run once at real exit, not at park)
;;   3. :thread unchanged: the same body under both backends, same result
;;   4. alts! wait set: value arrives on the second port; the waiter wakes with
;;      the right [val port] — once as a thread waiter, once as a fiber waiter
;;      (and the fiber waiter parks: a sibling fiber still runs meanwhile)
;;   5. alts! commits exactly once when several ports become ready at once
;;   6. a losing registration is pruned (assert the waiter list length)
;;   7. mixed take/put specs, :priority true, :default
;;
;; No timing or memory numbers in this round: do-alts was already a registered
;; single-handler wait before R4 — the 1ms polling loop the R4 spec draft
;; described never existed in this codebase (review correction), so there is no
;; before/after latency to report; R0/R3 measured the fiber machinery already.
