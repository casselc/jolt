;; continuations-test.clj — the jolt.continuations gate (issue #736).
;;
;; Pins the ONE-SHOT ESCAPE contract call-cc/letcc expose over the host's
;; call/1cc:
;;   * an escape returns its value from the call-cc form, from any depth;
;;   * falling through returns the body's value;
;;   * a `finally` between the capture and the escape RUNS (an escape is a real
;;     exit, unlike a fiber park, which drops those winders);
;;   * a binding/parameterize between them is restored;
;;   * a park between the capture and the escape is fine WITHIN one fiber — the
;;     fiber's stack segment is captured and restored whole.
;;
;; And the four ways to misuse it, each of which must raise a catchable jolt
;; error naming what happened. Two of them are why this file exists: before the
;; guard, invoking a continuation captured on another fiber HUNG the process
;; (no error, no timeout), and re-invoking one raised a Chez condition that
;; reached jolt as class :object: with an empty message.
;;
;; Every row that invokes a continuation across an ownership boundary runs on a
;; watchdog thread with a join deadline, so a regression that reinstates the
;; hang FAILS this gate instead of wedging it.
