;; test/chez/fibers-process-io-test.ss — R8 gate, extended to jolt.process
;; subprocess pipe I/O. Run:
;; chez --script test/chez/fibers-process-io-test.ss (wired into `make fibers`
;; immediately after fibers-io-test.ss).
;;
;; fibers-io-test.ss covers R8's socket half; this file covers the other half of
;; the same trick applied to a subprocess's stdin/stdout pipes:
;; proc-fd-input-port / proc-fd-output-port (host/chez/java/process.ss) set
;; O_NONBLOCK unconditionally on the pipe fd the parent retains, and on EAGAIN
;; ask jolt.io-poller to wait for readiness — parking the fiber when there is a
;; current fiber, blocking this thread when there is not. Same user-facing
;; jolt.process code either way. The retry loop also has a THIRD branch neither
;; socket.clj nor fibers-io-test.ss needs: off a fiber, when jolt.io-poller was
;; never required at all (jolt.process is usable standalone, and jolt.socket is
;; the only ns in the tree that requires the poller), EAGAIN clears O_NONBLOCK
;; on the fd and falls through to a real blocking read/write — behaviorally
;; identical to the pre-R8-extension code, once triggered. ON a fiber that same
;; state autoloads the poller instead, since falling back there is precisely the
;; carrier-pinning this file exists to rule out.
;;
;; Gate checks, in order:
;;   1. a fiber reading a subprocess pipe with nothing written yet PARKS, and a
;;      sibling fiber on the SAME carrier makes progress while it waits — the
;;      whole round in one check, same shape as fibers-io-test.ss's check 1.
;;   2. the same code path on a plain OS thread (no current fiber) still blocks
;;      and still works — a lower-bound elapsed-time check.
;;   3. jolt.host/gc-full! succeeds while the poller is blocked servicing a pipe
;;      registration (the __collect_safe property fibers-io-test.ss's check 3
;;      asserts for sockets — this is the same poller, so this is really a
;;      belt-and-suspenders repeat of it via a different registration path,
;;      worth asserting explicitly since jolt.process is a distinct caller of
;;      proc-poller-wait-ready from jolt.socket).
;;   4. N fibers (N picked below, see the note at its definition), each reading
;;      its OWN subprocess's pipe, all on ONE carrier: all N park at once, then
;;      all N complete with their own payload — real parking, not serialized
;;      blocking.
;;   5. jolt.process's existing higher-level API (process / sh / shell, :in /
;;      :out piping, @proc deref) is unaffected OFF a fiber — confirms the R8
;;      extension does not leak into or change the non-fiber path every
;;      existing jolt.process caller (process-test.clj, babashka.process
;;      itself) depends on.
;;   6. a FRESH Chez process that requires jolt.process but never
;;      jolt.io-poller (so proc-poller-wait-ready's var-deref finds it genuinely
;;      unbound, not just un-invoked) gets BOTH halves of the choice right: off a
;;      fiber it blocks correctly and leaves the poller unloaded — not a spurious
;;      short-read/EOF on the first EAGAIN, not a busy spin, and not a private
;;      kqueue per wait either; on a fiber it autoloads the poller and genuinely
;;      parks, with a sibling on the same carrier proving it. That fiber half is
;;      the one that reproduces jolt-641 in full if the autoload is removed, and
;;      it is the shape of every subprocess-driving fiber program that never
;;      opens a socket. No analog in fibers-io-test.ss: sockets always require
;;      jolt.io-poller by construction, so this state is only reachable through
;;      jolt.process. Runs the probe as a genuinely separate `chez --script`
;;      subprocess (see check 6 below) — jolt-var auto-vivifies an unbound
;;      placeholder for any never-required ns, so within ONE process there is
;;      no way back to "genuinely never required" once checks 1-5 have required
;;      jolt.io-poller for real parking.
;;   7. closing a pipe-read port while a fiber is parked on it must not strand
;;      the fiber — the CRITICAL close-races-a-parked-read regression: the fd
;;      close proc now tells jolt.io-poller to forget the fd (mirroring
;;      jolt.socket's socket-close!), which wakes any parked waiter instead of
;;      leaving it waiting on an event that will never come (the kernel
;;      auto-drops a closed fd from the kqueue/epoll set).
;;   8. a fiber write that fills a subprocess pipe parks, and a sibling fiber
;;      on the SAME carrier makes real progress while the write is blocked —
;;      the write-side twin of check 1, closing the permanent-gate coverage
;;      gap the write path (EAGAIN branch + fcntl fallback, symmetric with the
;;      read side) had until now.
;;   9. closing a pipe-WRITE port while a fiber is parked on it makes the woken
;;      fiber take the port's closed? short-circuit, rather than re-running
;;      proc-c-write against a fd the close proc has already closed (and that
;;      the kernel may already have reassigned to an unrelated
;;      pipe/socket/open) with a buf it has already free()d. Check 7's twin one
;;      level deeper: check 7 asserts the woken fiber is not STRANDED, this one
;;      asserts WHICH path it takes once woken.
;;
;; Watchdog: the whole workload (all 9 checks) runs on a forked thread; this
;; script's main thread does nothing but watch a hard-coded deadline. A wedge
;; anywhere in the workload — including a raw blocking spawn/read call that
;; isn't wrapped in wait-until's own per-check bound — fails the gate loudly
;; with the phase it was in and jolt.io-poller's debug-state, instead of
;; hanging `make fibers` silently. Same shape as test/chez/poller-registration.clj's
;; watchdog, adapted to this file's plain Chez-thread (not Jolt Thread/System)
;; primitives, since this is a raw gate-boot .ss script, not a .clj file run
;; through jolt.
