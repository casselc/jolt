;; test/chez/async-timer-test.ss — the shared (timeout ms) timer (jolt-pe84).
;; Run: chez --script test/chez/async-timer-test.ss (wired into `make asynctimer`).
;;
;; One timer thread serves every (timeout ms) in the process, which makes the two
;; things asserted here properties of the WHOLE channel surface: alts! against a
;; timeout, core.async's own timeout-driven operators, and a fiber parked on a
;; timeout all resume when this timer says so.
;;
;;   1. A timeout closes on ITS OWN deadline, whatever else is pending. The timer
;;      used to sleep to the nearest deadline with timeout-mu released, so it was
;;      not on timeout-cv when a nearer deadline was inserted; the signal was
;;      dropped and the new timeout fired at the OLD deadline. (timeout 100)
;;      behind a pending (timeout 3000) took 3000ms. That is what the lateness
;;      checks are for, and why each one is measured against a far pending
;;      deadline rather than in isolation.
;;   2. The timer thread is forked ONCE. It waits rather than exiting when the
;;      pending list empties, so clearing timeout-running? before that wait made
;;      the next insert both signal the live thread AND fork another: 100
;;      sequential (timeout 1) calls left 100 live timer threads. The flag is the
;;      fork guard, so asserting it stays set across a drain to empty IS the
;;      no-leak check — Chez gives a script no way to count its own threads.
;;
;; White-box on purpose: the interesting states (an empty pending list, a far
;; deadline pending) are not reachable from a black-box read of a channel, and
;; timeout-pending / timeout-running? are top-level defines in async.ss, which
;; this gate loads into the same environment.
