;; UTF-8 bytes -> text, against what the JVM's decoder answers
;; (host/chez/java/natives-str.ss utf8-bytes->string, and decode-bytevector in
;; host/chez/java/host-static-classes.ss).
;;   chez --script test/chez/utf8-decode-test.ss
;;
;; Chez's utf8->string and java.nio's decoder agree on every well-formed input.
;; They disagree on malformed input, because they disagree about how many BYTES
;; a bad sequence costs: Java replaces per malformed RUN and decides the run
;; length the way sun.nio.cs.UTF_8's malformedN does, so an overlong lead is
;; rejected alone and the continuation bytes behind it each become a stray of
;; their own. Chez folds the whole sequence into one replacement. They also
;; disagree about a leading BOM, which Chez swallows.
;;
;; jolt used utf8->string for every byte->text seam, so (slurp (io/input-stream
;; f)) answered differently from (slurp f) on the same bytes (jolt-dta.13).
;;
;; What is pinned here:
;;   - the named rows, each one verified against real JVM Clojure
;;   - 2702 random byte strings whose answers came from the JVM
;;     (utf8-decode-oracle.txt — see its header)
;;   - the GUARD's soundness, which is the whole performance argument: when
;;     %utf8-java-plain? says yes, jolt keeps Chez's C decoder, so a false yes
;;     is a silent wrong answer. Every row above is checked that way too, and
;;     so is every sequence of length 1..3 over the bytes at the class
;;     boundaries — 18278 of them, exhaustive where the decoder branches.
;;   - that decode-bytevector, the seam (String. bytes) reaches, uses it
