;; Hot-path shape gates: split-with-limit, timeout arming, deque draining,
;; StringTokenizer, ns-publics/refer, and set/intersection must not scale
;; worse than linearly (or must be independent of a dimension they used to
;; scale with). One file, one boot: each section is the same in-process
;; judgment as read_scaling_test.clj — best-of-5 over alternating arms, only
;; ratios, sized so a REGRESSED implementation still finishes and fails rather
;; than hanging.
;;
;; What each section pins (all were real, found in the 2026-08 structural
;; sweep):
;;   split      (.split s LIMIT) recomputed (length out) per part — O(parts^2).
;;   timeout    core.async timeout arming was a linear sorted-list insert —
;;              O(k^2) for a burst; now a binary min-heap.
;;   deque      ArrayDeque/LinkedList front ops shifted the whole backing
;;              vector — the standard .poll worklist idiom was O(n^2).
;;   tokenizer  StringTokenizer called length/list-ref per token — O(n^2).
;;   ns-shape   ns-publics/refer scanned EVERY interned var in the image, so a
;;              3-var namespace cost O(total vars) — judged as shape
;;              independence: interning 30k unrelated vars must not change
;;              what ns-publics of a tiny ns costs.
;;   set-shape  intersection walked its FIRST argument — big ∩ small must cost
;;              what small ∩ big costs (the reference's smaller-side swap).
