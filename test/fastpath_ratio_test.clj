;; The fast paths that keep reading and string-scanning off the slow route, each
;; gated as a RATIO against a reference the same run measures on the same machine.
;;
;; These are constant-factor gates, and that is why they are not written like
;; read_scaling_test.clj or io_scaling_test.clj. Every regression below is
;; perfectly LINEAR — it just has a terrible constant — so a 1x-vs-4x scaling
;; ratio sees nothing at all. What separates fast from slow here is that the same
;; work is available two ways, and the slow way is 5-70x the fast one. Measuring
;; both arms in one process and judging their ratio needs no absolute budget, no
;; baseline file, and no babashka in CI.
;;
;; What each arm gates (all figures x86_64, jolt vs babashka 1.12, 2026-09-13):
;;
;;   reader-vs-string   (read <stream-backed PushbackReader>) used to drain the
;;                      reader one character at a time through
;;                      record-method-dispatch — a method-table lookup by hashing
;;                      the jhost tag and a handler lookup by hashing the method
;;                      NAME, per character. 332 files cost 3909 ms against bb's
;;                      57; the same parse from a string cost 52. The reference
;;                      arm IS that string parse, so the gate asks: does reading
;;                      from a stream still cost about what reading from a string
;;                      costs?
;;
;;   chunked-vs-slurp   .read(char[]) is the memory-bounded way to read a large
;;                      file, and it was SLOWER than reading the whole thing
;;                      (2.7x), because the fill loop set one array element at a
;;                      time through the checked generic setter. The gate asks
;;                      the question that made it absurd: is the bounded read at
;;                      least not slower than the unbounded one?
;;
;;   literal-split      #"\n" is a literal, and running an irregex search per
;;   literal-replace    line to find one character cost ~10x. The reference arm
;;   split-lines        is the SAME call with a literal string separator, which
;;                      always took the index scan. If the literal recognizer
;;                      stops recognising, the regex arm falls back to the engine
;;                      and the ratio jumps.
;;
;;   small-file-drain   the regression that ACTUALLY SHIPPED during this work.
;;                      A block-reading drain that sizes its scratch to the BLOCK
;;                      rather than to the input reads large files beautifully and
;;                      allocates 64 KB to hold 200 bytes — once per file. Every
;;                      other arm here uses a large payload and saw nothing; a
;;                      suite that reads many small files went from 900 ms to
;;                      1.8 s. The reference arm reads the SAME FILES, the same
;;                      number of times, by PATH — which takes the bytevector
;;                      route and never touches the drain. Holding everything but
;;                      the drain constant is what makes the ratio sharp.
;;
;;   chars-copy         a char array's backing IS a Chez string, so .toCharArray
;;   string-from-chars  is a string copy and (String. ca) is a substring of it.
;;                      Both used to build a cons per character and then walk the
;;                      list again — 21x babashka on the chunked-read path that
;;                      feeds them. The reference arm for both is (subs s 0 n),
;;                      which copies exactly as many characters by a route that
;;                      was always a block move. If the backing goes back to a
;;                      boxed vector, both arms walk again and the ratios jump
;;                      (measured: 0.68 -> 2.47 and 1.00 -> 1.63).
;;
;;   char-alloc         the same backing, seen with no traversal in it at all.
;;                      A char array of n elements is a flat 4-byte-per-character
;;                      string the collector never traces; a boxed vector of the
;;                      same n is n POINTERS at 8 bytes that it traces on every
;;                      major GC. So allocating a char array must be FASTER than
;;                      allocating a long array of the same length — the ceiling
;;                      here is deliberately below 1.0, and a boxed char backing
;;                      brings it straight back to parity (0.49 -> 1.02).
;;
;;   substring-scan     str-index-of is the widest-reach scan in the string
;;                      layer: indexOf, contains, literal split and both literal
;;                      replaces all run it once per character. It called
;;                      char-by-char-match? at EVERY position, so the call cost
;;                      more than the comparison — testing the first character
;;                      inline took a 7.8 MB miss from 56 ms to 18 ms. The
;;                      reference arm is the SAME search with a CHAR needle,
;;                      which takes str-char-index and never had an inner call,
;;                      so it is unaffected by the regression and measures 23 ms
;;                      on both sides (0.80 -> 2.43).
;;
;;   trim-no-copy       clojure.string/trim was (trimr (triml s)), and triml
;;                      copied the whole string even with nothing to trim, so
;;                      trimming an already-trimmed string allocated it twice.
;;                      This one IS a scaling test, and deliberately: trimming a
;;                      string that needs no trimming must cost the same whether
;;                      the string is short or long. A copying trim is linear in
;;                      the length; a scanning one is not.
;;
;;   reify-instance     (instance? SomeProtocol r) on a reify walked every
;;   deftype-instance   host-shim instance-check arm (23 of them, each passing)
;;                      and then munged every declared protocol name to compare
;;                      it — ~3.5 us for a reify of six protocols against the
;;                      JVM's ~14 ns, ~500 ns for a deftype. core.logic asks it
;;                      of every var and constraint on every propagation step,
;;                      and its finite-domain solver spent 56 s seeing a trivial
;;                      contradiction. The reference arm calls a protocol method
;;                      on the same value, which never walked anything. Measured
;;                      before/after: reify 204 -> 1.38, deftype 7.75 -> 1.13.
;;
;;   instance-miss      ...and a NO walked all of them every time, then the
;;   number-miss        JVM taxonomy: 500-700 ns for (instance? IVar 5), which
;;                      core.logic asks of every term it walks. The builtin arms'
;;                      verdict per value kind is memoized now, the library arm
;;                      still asked live (31 -> 1.55, 22 -> 1.37).
;;
;;   instance-site      ...and past both memos, each (instance? T x) SITE caches
;;   instance-site-type its last type argument and receiver kind, so a repeat is
;;                      two eq?s and an epoch compare — the shape of the JVM's
;;                      inlined instanceof, where the memo path still interned the
;;                      type name and read two tables per call. Held BELOW a
;;                      protocol call: the site measures 0.32 (quoted name) and
;;                      0.42 (a deftype as T) of one; without it, 1.15-1.95.
;;
;;   reify-construct    (reify …) built a {kw fn} map and then a hashtable from it
;;                      per instance (~310 ns against the JVM's ~25). The layout is
;;                      the site's, built once; an instance is a vector of fns.
;;                      The reference constructs a deftype (8.9 -> 1.05).
;;
;;   satisfies-reify    satisfies? on a reify re-munged every declared protocol
;;                      name ahead of the match (13.5 -> 0.82).
;;
;;   record-key-get     a map keyed on a deftype that declares equals/hashCode
;;                      (core.logic's LVar) looked both methods up by NAME, in two
;;                      string-keyed tables, on every key compared, and its
;;                      (.-id ^EqKey o) field read interned a keyword per call.
;;                      The reference is the same lookup over defrecord keys,
;;                      whose = is structural with no method to call, so the
;;                      ratio is what calling a declared equals adds per key
;;                      (4.66 -> 2.3; the JVM ~1.0). The field read then went
;;                      through record-method-dispatch's per-type table, ~40 ns
;;                      of every compare; a per-site cache of the receiver's type
;;                      and slot made it ~14 (2.3 -> 1.65).
;;
;;   record-eq          = on two records walked every registered equality arm
;;                      (the record arm registered first, so it was asked last)
;;                      and then looked the types' equiv and equals up by name
;;                      per compare: ~225 ns against ~36 for two one-element
;;                      vectors, and a small map keyed on records scans with =.
;;                      The reference is = on two equal vectors (6.8 -> 1.36).
;;
;;   top-level-fn       a fn built in a bare top-level form — every deftype and
;;                      defrecord method, every extend-type impl and defmethod —
;;                      got no constant pool, so each keyword literal in it
;;                      re-interned on every call. The reference is the same fn
;;                      built under a def, which always had one (2.38 -> 1.02).
;;
;; Only the ratios are judged, never the absolute times — a slow shared runner
;; moves both arms together. Sampling follows io_scaling_test.clj: best-of-N
;; (minimum, not mean — interference only ever adds time), a ceiling, a
;; clear-regression threshold that fails on the spot, and one re-measure in the
;; band between them so a single scheduler blip cannot fail the build. A real
;; regression measures far above the ceiling on every attempt, so re-measuring
;; costs no power.
