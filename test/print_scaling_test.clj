;; Rendering a collection must cost time LINEAR in the printed length.
;;
;; jolt-str-join / jolt-str-join-comma (host/chez/rt.ss) were right-folds of
;; string-append, so element i's copy cost was the length of the entire
;; remaining suffix — O(n*L) over the whole render, on EVERY collection print:
;; both printers (str-style and pr-readable), record printing, sorted-coll
;; printing. The fix joins through a string output port, one pass. The same
;; right-fold lived in host/gambit/rt-core.ss, and sorted-map rendering
;; (host-table.ss) carried its own accumulator-first string-append.
;;
;; Same judgment as read_scaling_test.clj: the SHAPE, in one run — quadrupling
;; the element count must not quadruple the per-element cost. Linear lands near
;; 4, the old right-fold near 16; both arms run best-of-3 and only the
;; in-process ratio is judged. Correctness (exact rendering) is asserted on
;; small values here and pinned broadly by the corpus; this file is about cost.

;;
;; 5 rather than 3, because the arms here are SMALL — the 1x record arm renders in
;; ~7ms — and this gate cannot be resized the way read_scaling_test.clj was.
;; Per-element cost grows with n across this whole range (record: 1.77us at 4000,
;; 4.10 at 16000, 5.44 at 32000, 5.93 at 64000; vector: 0.61, 0.63, 1.56, 1.84),
;; so there is no flat regime to move onto — 16000 -> 64000 measures 9.05 on the
;; vector arm and would fail outright. These sizes are the best window available.
;;
;; And not more than 5: sampling is not free, and CI runs the suite as
;; `make -j$(nproc) test`, where a gate that holds a core longer starves the other
;; timing gates beside it — an earlier revision of these two files did exactly that
;; to the complexity gate, whose ceiling sits at 2.0 over 3ms measurements. Five is
;; enough for the property: on an idle machine the reported ratios sit at 4.07-4.15
;; and 4.39-4.42 across runs, and the retry below covers the rare episode that
;; sampling cannot.

;; ...and if the ratio still comes out over the ceiling, re-measure the whole
;; thing this many times before failing.
;;
;; Both arms of the record check allocate ~n intermediate records (each assoc
;; conses a new one), so a GC episode can span every run of a best-of and inflate
;; the arm as a whole — which best-of alone cannot filter. The record ratio
;; measures ~4.6 against a ceiling of 8.0, so there is only ~1.7x of headroom for
;; that to eat, and it did: this gate failed twice during one afternoon's work,
;; once on a tree with no local changes at all (ratio 8.71).
;;
;; Retrying costs nothing in POWER, which is the point. A genuine quadratic
;; regression measures ~16 — it is over the ceiling on every attempt and still
;; fails deterministically. Only a one-off interference episode passes on retry,
;; and that is exactly the case that was never a real failure.
