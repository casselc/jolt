;; Lazy realization must cost the same whether or not a thread has ever existed.
;;
;; A lazy cell (host/chez/lazy-bridge.ss) and a seq cell with a deferred tail
;; (host/chez/seq.ss) publish their result through ONE field: the tail slot holds
;; the thunk until it is forced and the seq after, told apart by type. A reader
;; therefore never locks: it loads the slot and either has its answer or takes the
;; slow path. Exclusion is needed only to run a thunk once, and the mutex for that
;; is borrowed from a pool for the duration of the force, so a program pays no
;; per-cell mutex — a Chez mutex is a finalized object the collector has to visit,
;; and paying one per lazy element made every collection ~120x dearer the moment a
;; single thread had been forked, for the rest of the process.
;;
;; Two assertions:
;;
;;   ONCE-ONLY — eight threads walk the same unrealized seqs at once. Every
;;   producer runs exactly once per element, every walker sees the same values,
;;   and a producer that throws throws the SAME failure to every walker. This is
;;   the contract the lock-free read path must not weaken.
;;
;;   SCALING — one workload, run before any thread exists and again after one
;;   has existed, in ONE process, judged by COUNTING the mutexes it allocates
;;   (jolt.host/mutex-allocations, host/chez/scheme-adapter-runtime.ss). That count is exactly what
;;   the guarded regression changes: a mutex per lazy cell once a thread has
;;   existed is ~600,000 for this workload (one per claimed force), and the claim
;;   design allocates none in either arm. The count is the cause of the old slowdown (a finalized object
;;   per cell, each visited by every collection), so judging it judges the
;;   slowdown without a clock: it reads the same on an idle machine and a loaded
;;   one, where a timed ratio (~1.75 for the claim, ~5 for a mutex per cell)
;;   drifted toward its ceiling with the runner's neighbours. The time of each
;;   arm is still printed, as information.
