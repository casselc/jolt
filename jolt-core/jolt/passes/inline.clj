  :inline-chain is a vector of [callee-fqn call-line] pairs, INNERMOST FIRST.
  Each entry says \"the code here belongs to callee-fqn, which was called at
  call-line of the next frame out\"; the last entry's call-line is a line in the
  physical fn the whole thing ended up inside. Reading it back: the node's own
  line locates the first entry's fn, entry i's call-line locates entry i+1's, and
  the final call-line locates the physical fn (source-registry jolt-site-frame*).

  APPENDS rather than overwrites, which is what makes nesting work. inline-node
  runs bottom-up, so when C is spliced into P the body already carries whatever
  chain an earlier splice into C left; appending [C at] puts P's view outside it.
  deep-boom spliced into mid-boom spliced into -main ends up
  [[deep-boom 70] [mid-boom 31]], and reports three frames.

  `outer` is the chain the CALL SITE already carried, and it goes on the end of
  every stamped node. Without it a splice into an already-spliced region loses
  everything above the region: mid-boom is spliced into -main, the fixpoint then
  splices deep-boom into that copy, and deep-boom's nodes would claim
  [[deep-boom 70]] alone — naming -main at a line in another file.

;; --- record constructors as foldable struct sources -------------------------
;; A record ctor (->Rec a b ..) is a positional struct: the registry maps its
;; ctor key ("ns/->Name", exactly how the IR names the call head) to the DECLARED
;; field order. A field read on a non-escaping ctor folds to the matching arg,
;; just as (:k {:k a ..}) folds to a. Two soundness differences from maps:
;;   - the ctor's args are duplicated/discarded, so they must be pure (like map
;;     vals), and the arg count must equal the field count (a positional call);
;;   - a record answers the virtual :jolt/deftype key with its type tag and any
;;     other non-field key with nil — neither is a positional arg, so we only
;;     fold DECLARED-field reads and keep the allocation otherwise.
