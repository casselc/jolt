(ns jolt.completions
  "`jolt completions` — shell completion for jolt's own commands and a project's
  tasks.

    jolt completions zsh    # the function to source, for zsh / bash / fish
    jolt completions tasks  # name<TAB>doc per listable task, for that function

  The split between those two is the whole design, and it is a departure from
  babashka, which calls its binary back on every TAB press to compute the
  candidates for the line so far.

  Jolt cannot afford that. Its floor is the Chez runtime coming up, about 0.22s
  whatever it is asked for, and `jolt version` costs the same as `jolt tasks`.
  A quarter of a second between pressing TAB and seeing anything is the
  difference between completion that feels instant and completion that feels
  broken, and no amount of care inside the process removes it.

  So the two halves are split by how often they change. jolt's own commands and
  options change when the binary does, so they are baked into the snippet at the
  moment it is generated and cost nothing afterwards. A project's tasks change
  when its deps.edn or bb.edn changes, so the snippet caches them against those
  two mtimes and calls back only when one of them moves. A warm press reads a
  small file, and jolt does not run at all."

;; The commands a task can take the name of. jolt.main dispatches a built-in
;; ahead of a task of the same name unless the task sets :override-builtin, and
;; this set has to be the one main checks — a name here that main does not guard
;; would hide a task that actually runs.
(def ^:private overridable

(defn task-lines
  "One line per listable task: `name<TAB>doc`, or the bare name when it has no
  :doc. This is the only part a completing shell has to ask jolt for, and it
  goes through jolt.tasks/listable so that TAB and `jolt tasks` agree on which
  tasks exist.

  A task that PARSES its arguments — one with :exec-fn or :cmd — gets a third
  field, `cli`, and an empty doc field when it has no :doc. That marker is what
  lets a snippet know which tasks are worth calling jolt back for: the options
  and subcommands of such a task live behind babashka.cli and cannot be cached
  as a flat list, while a plain task has nothing to offer after its name and
  must keep costing a completing shell nothing.

  A task that shares a built-in's name is dropped unless it wins that name,
  because a completion's description is a promise about what the word will do.
  `jolt tasks` is a list of what the project defines and lists such a task
  either way; this is a list of what typing the word gets you, and for a task
  that loses to a built-in the answer is the built-in. The snippet offers what
  comes back here BEFORE its own baked-in commands, so an overriding task's
  description is the one that survives the shell's de-duplication."
