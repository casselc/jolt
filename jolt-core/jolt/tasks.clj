(ns jolt.tasks
  "The task runner behind `jolt <task>` / `jolt run <task>` / `jolt tasks`.

  Tasks come from a project's bb.edn or deps.edn `:tasks` map (jolt.deps merges
  both, bb.edn last) and follow babashka's semantics:

    {:tasks {:init     (def version \"1.2.3\")     ; once, before any task
             :requires ([babashka.fs :as fs])      ; for every task
             :enter    (println \"->\" (:name (current-task)))
             :leave    (println \"<-\" (:name (current-task)))

             clean {:doc \"remove build output\" :task (fs/delete-tree \"target\")}
             build {:doc \"build\" :depends [clean] :task (shell \"make\")}
             ship  {:requires ([app.release :as r]) :task (r/ship! version)}}}

  A task's value is either a map — :doc, :task (the body), :depends, :requires,
  :private, :extra-paths, :extra-deps — or the body on its own. Bodies run in
  the `user` namespace with clojure.core and babashka.tasks referred, so
  `shell`, `jolt`, `clojure`, `run` and `current-task` are available
  unqualified, and the arguments after the task name are *command-line-args*.

  Two forms are jolt's own rather than babashka's, and work in either file:
  a STRING body is a shell command line (babashka would evaluate it as an
  expression, which does nothing), and a map with :main-opts runs them like an
  alias's — `{:doc \"test\" :main-opts [\"-m\" \"app.test\"]}`.

  jolt.main injects what it owns (how to resolve the project, how to run
  :main-opts) rather than being required back — this namespace is loaded only
  when a task actually runs, and stays out of the CLI's startup closure.

  babashka.tasks is required lazily for the same reason, one level down: a
  string or :main-opts task with no hooks needs neither it nor the
  babashka.process it pulls in, and requiring it up front put half a second on
  every `jolt <task>` that only wanted to run a shell line.")

;; string and hands it to SCI; jolt evaluates the task map directly, so the same
;; semantics are wired here as ordinary function calls. The reference is
;; babashka.impl.tasks at 1.13.223 — cli-node, -task-node, -cli-dispatch,
;; -run-cli-dep — and the shapes below keep its names so the two can be read
;; side by side.
;;
;; Errors here are plain ex-info, not babashka's {:babashka/exit 1}: in jolt that
;; key means "exit with this status, the failure has already reported itself",
;; which is right for a failed subprocess and wrong for a mistake in a bb.edn —
;; it would make an unresolvable :exec-fn exit 1 in silence.
;;
;; One babashka behaviour is deliberately not here: it falls back to a handler's
;; DOCSTRING for a task with no :doc, in `bb tasks` and in completion. Both of
;; those read the project's config files alone on jolt (see jolt.completions on
;; why a completing shell must not be what discovers your deps don't resolve),
;; and deriving that doc means loading the handler's namespace. A docstring still
;; reaches --help, where the fn is being resolved anyway.

;; babashka.cli on first use, like babashka.tasks above and for the same reason:
;; a :tasks map that names no :exec-fn and no :cmd parses nothing, and loading
;; the parser up front would put it on every `jolt <task>` that only wanted to
