(ns ^{:skip-wiki true} clojure.core.async.impl.dispatch
  "The workload -> Executor mapping core.async.flow runs its processes on.

  Upstream this namespace is also core.async's own go-block dispatcher; on jolt
  the channel runtime is Scheme (host/chez/java/async.ss) and dispatches itself,
  so what remains here is the executor registry flow asks for by workload tag.

  The three tags mean what they mean for clojure.core.async/thread-call, and get
  the same carriers:

    :io      a fiber. Blocking-shaped I/O that the runtime can see — channel ops,
             jolt.socket reads, subprocess pipes — PARKS and frees its carrier, so
             a flow can hold far more :io processes than there are threads, and
             each costs a stack rather than an OS thread. A flow process's loop is
             mostly channel ops, which is exactly this shape.
    :mixed   a real thread, one per task. A :mixed step may block somewhere the
             runtime cannot see (Thread/sleep, a raw fd, a blocking FFI call), and
             that pins a fiber's carrier; a thread is the escape. One per task and
             not a pool because a flow process's task is its whole lifetime —
             pooling buys no reuse, while a bounded pool silently strands every
             process past the worker count.
    :compute a cached pool. Unlike the other two this runs one SHORT task per
             message (flow futurizes a :compute step per call and waits on it), so
             thread reuse is the whole point: a stream of :compute calls is served
             by the handful of workers that keep up with it, and a burst grows the
             pool rather than queueing behind a fixed ceiling."
