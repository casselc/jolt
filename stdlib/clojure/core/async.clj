;; clojure.core.async — higher-level dataflow API over the channel primitives.
;;
;; The primitives (chan, <!, >!, <!!, >!!, close!, put!, take!, offer!, timeout,
;; promise-chan, buffer/dropping-buffer/sliding-buffer, thread, go-spawn,
;; fiber-spawn, fiber-execute) are provided natively (host/chez/java/async.ss);
;; everything but the two fiber ones (fiber-spawn is io-thread's carrier — see
;; thread-call below; fiber-execute is the same spawn without a result channel,
;; behind clojure.core.async.impl.dispatch's :io Executor) runs on real OS
;; threads. go and go-loop
;; are NOT: they are defined below, because the pass that picks a park's
;; representation per site needs &env, macroexpand and resolve. This overlay
;; adds the portable dataflow operators — alts!, pipe, pipeline, split, reduce,
;; transduce, mult, mix, pub/sub, map, merge, and the deprecated map</map>/… —
;; ported from clojure.core.async over those primitives. Because go blocks are real
;; threads, parking ops are ordinary blocking ops and work anywhere; this is a
;; superset of the JVM model (no fixed thread pool, no pending-op limit).

;; --- go, and the cheap park -------------------------------------------------
;; go spawns its body on the backend *go-backend* names, read at spawn time.
;;
;; A fiber parks by capturing a continuation, and Chez represents that as a stack
;; segment that stays live for as long as the process is parked. A park the pass
;; below can SEE does not need one: it rewrites the rest of the body into a
;; closure, and __sm-take / __sm-put store the closure and switch to the
;; scheduler without capturing anything (host/chez/java/sm.ss).
;;
;; The choice is per PARK SITE, not per body. A park the pass cannot see or cannot
;; rewrite — inside a called function, inside a try, inside a nested fn, reached
;; through eval — is left exactly as it is and parks by capturing, which is what
;; every park does today. So the pass is opportunistic: it can cost a park its
;; cheap representation, never its correctness. When it has nothing to gain it
;; returns nil and go expands the way it always has.
;;
;; Not covered: alts! / alt! (threading a continuation through the waiter
;; registration in __do-alts is its own round), and any park inside a try (the
;; rewrite would have to carry the exception frame explicitly).

;; The park ops, by identity. Resolving the caller's symbol and comparing the VAR
;; is the only sound test: a user function named <! must be left alone. A macro
;; that expands to a park is invisible to the pre-scan, which costs it the cheap
;; park and nothing else.
;;
;; <!! and >!! are the same ops as <! and >!: identical on a fiber (parking a
;; blocking take preserves what it means without holding the carrier) and already
;; identical on a thread.

;; as expressions — a silent miscompile. case* / deftype* / reify* are
;; unreachable today (jolt's `case` expands to let* + if, `reify` to a
;; (make-reified {...} "iface") call), so they are here to make the fallback true
;; by construction rather than by accident of how those macros expand.
;;
;; syntax-quote is the one head special-syms does not name and jolt still lowers
;; as a special form, because jolt's reader leaves a backtick as
;; (syntax-quote datum) for the analyzer while the JVM's reader expands it during
;; read. So the set to complement is jolt's analyzer `handled`, not the portable
;; special-syms, and dropping the difference cost `(go (list `(<! ch) :done))` its
;; meaning: the datum is data, but the :else arm rebuilt it as an application,

;; --- thread variants --------------------------------------------------------

;; Three carriers, three names, no options — the choice is the call you write:
;; thread is a real OS thread, io-thread is a fiber, go is the CPS pass on
;; whatever *go-backend* names. So workload is not a hint here, it selects:
;;
;;   :io       a FIBER. Cheap enough to have thousands of, and a park releases
;;             the carrier — which is what the JVM buys with a virtual thread.
;;   :mixed    a real OS thread (the default, as on the JVM).
;;   :compute  a real OS thread.
;;
;; :compute is a thread rather than a fiber deliberately, even though preemption
;; means a compute-bound fiber no longer starves its carrier's queue: fibers are
;; capped at the carrier count, so N compute bodies on N carriers leave nothing to
;; run the io-thread bodies that are ready. A thread per compute body is what the
;; caller asked for by saying :compute.
;;
;; What a fiber does NOT get is an OS thread of its own, so a body that blocks
;; SOMEWHERE THE RUNTIME DOES NOT KNOW ABOUT pins its carrier for the duration.
;; Channel ops park, and so do jolt.socket's reads and writes and jolt.process's
;; subprocess pipe reads and writes (R8: an EAGAIN registers with the io-poller
;; and parks). Thread/sleep, a blocking read on a raw fd you opened yourself, and
;; an FFI call that blocks do not — they hold the carrier's OS thread. Use thread
;; for those; that is what it is for.
(defn thread-call

  anywhere in the body — inside a called function, a try, a loop — because a fiber
  parks by capturing its continuation, not by being rewritten.
