; Jolt Standard Library: clojure.test
;
; A practical subset of clojure.test for running real test suites under Jolt:
; deftest / is / testing / are / use-fixtures / run-tests, with class-aware
; (thrown? Class body) and (thrown-with-msg? Class re body) inside `is`. Class
; matching is by simple-name (last dotted segment), since Jolt has no JVM class
; objects — Exception/Throwable match any thrown value.
;
; Also exposes the counter/registry API the internal clojure-test-suite harness
; uses (reset-report!, run-registered, n-pass/n-fail/n-error, failures), so this
; is a drop-in superset.
