(ns babashka.tasks
  "The API a bb.edn (or deps.edn) `:tasks` body is written against — babashka's
  task namespace, on jolt.

  Every task body runs with these referred, so a task calls them unqualified:

    {:tasks {build {:task (shell \"cc -o app app.c\")}
             all   {:depends [build] :task (run 'test)}}}

  `shell` is babashka.process/shell — it inherits stdio and throws on a
  non-zero exit, and the runner turns that throw into jolt's own exit status.

  `jolt` re-invokes this CLI. `clojure` is the same function under babashka's
  name for it, so a bb.edn that calls `(clojure \"-M:test\")` runs here — on
  this host jolt IS the Clojure, and the point of the exercise is not to need a
  JVM. Write `jolt` in new task maps; it says what it does. Shell out
  explicitly — `(shell \"clojure\" \"-M:test\")` — to reach the real
  Clojure CLI.

  jolt.tasks is the runner; this namespace is only the surface it binds.

  babashka.process is resolved on first use rather than required here: a task
  namespace refers these whether or not the task shells out, and loading the
  process layer for a task body that only prints cost half a second on every
  run.")
