;; jolt.io-poller — one readiness poller per process (kqueue on macOS, epoll on
;; Linux, WSAPoll on Windows) behind one internal interface, plus the fd-level syscall helpers the
;; socket layer needs (fibers R8, epic jolt-nvpr.8 — sockets + poller half).
;;
;; Why this exists: a blocking call on a fiber PINTS its carrier, and since
;; continuations cannot migrate (R0(d)), the fibers queued behind it are
;; stranded. So the socket layer sets O_NONBLOCK, and on EAGAIN asks this module
;; to wait for readiness — parking the fiber (via the jolt.host seams installed
;; in host/chez/java/fibers-async.ss) when there is a current fiber, and doing a
;; plain blocking kevent/epoll_wait on this thread when there is not. Same
;; user-facing code either way.
;;
;; The poller thread blocks in kevent/epoll_wait with the :blocking marker
;; (__collect_safe). That is measured, not theoretical: a thread inside a
;; foreign call that is not collect-safe stays ACTIVE for Chez's stop-the-world
;; collector, and a collection from another thread then fails outright with
;; "cannot collect when multiple threads are active" — a poller that is not
;; collect-safe stops the whole process from collecting for as long as it waits,
;; which is nearly always. The R8 gate asserts a full collect succeeds while the
;; poller is blocked.
;;
;; Registration races (a fiber registering while the poller is already inside
;; kevent/epoll_wait) are closed with a control pipe, the textbook shape: the
;; pipe read end is always in the poller's set, a registration writes a byte to
;; the write end, and the poller drains pending registrations into its kq/epoll
;; on every wake. Never a timed poll, never a sleep in the wait path. (A timed
;; wait — SO_TIMEOUT, a timed connect — bounds the WAITER, not the poller: see
;; wait-ready's deadline arity.)
;;
;; Locking: the table (fds, pending, pipe) is mutated under ONE monitor (pm).
;; The fiber's commit-to-park (jolt.host/fiber-park-commit!) runs under pm, and
;; the poller's wake collects woken fibers under pm and resumes them AFTER
;; releasing it — the R3 deliver-vs-park race, closed the same way alt-deliver!
;; closes it (both the commit and the wake's state read are serialized by the
;; caller's lock; pm is a new leaf in the lock chain: nothing the park path does
;; takes the run-queue mutex, and the wake resumes outside pm).
;;
;; What this file CANNOT do, and does not have to. The channel ops bracket their
;; commit and their switch in disable-interrupts, because between the two the fiber
;; is marked but has not left, and a preemption there takes the commit apart. This
;; file is Clojure and has no such bracket: wait-fiber commits under pm and switches
;; after releasing it, so the gap is open here by construction. The scheduler closes
;; it instead — jolt-fiber-preempt-handler refuses to preempt a fiber that is not
;; 'running, which is exactly the set of fibers that have committed to a transition
;; they have not finished (jolt-9d3m, and fibers-preempt-test.ss section 12). So the
;; order below matters and the interrupt state does not: commit under pm, release,
;; then switch.

;; Both are keyed by (fd, FILTER), not by fd, because that is what a registration
;; actually is: kqueue keys a registration by (ident, filter), and the two

;; lost registrations and delivered wakeups to the wrong waiter:
;;
;;   :pending held ONE filter per fd, and wait-fiber skipped the wake when the fd
;;   was already present. So a fiber waiting to WRITE an fd that another fiber had
;;   just queued a READ registration for was never registered with the kernel at
;;   all: its filter was dropped on the floor, and no event for it could ever
;;   arrive. Reachable state (fd registered for read only, nothing pending, a
;;   write-waiter parked) confirmed by model-checking the protocol.
;;
;;   :waiters was one flat list per fd, so process-events! resumed EVERY waiter on
;;   an fd whichever filter fired. A read event woke the write-waiters too; they
;;   retried, got EAGAIN and re-registered. That is what masked the bug above
;;   whenever read traffic happened to arrive, and it is why the hang needs a
