(ns jolt.image
  "Write program state to a file and read it back, on another machine or another
  CPU architecture.

  This is a STATE image, not a process image. The value graph travels; execution
  does not. There are no thread stacks, no continuations, and nothing suspended
  mid-call comes back. See RFC 0009 for the design.

  Functions travel as data. A fn that is some var's root is written as the
  var's NAME and resolved on the way back in, so it stays callable and IS the
  live fn. An anonymous closure travels as its SOURCE — the fn* form plus the
  captured values, recovered from the live closure — and restore compiles it
  back in its defining namespace. That makes an image code: restoring one
  evaluates the fn sources it carries, so only load images you trust, the
  same way you would only load code you trust.

  Lazy sequences travel unforced, and stay lazy: an infinite one keeps
  generating after a restore, and a side effect that had not run still has not.
  A multimethod, a reify, and a namespace travel as their name and come back as
  the live object.

  What still refuses: a closure whose captured local was optimized into the
  compiled code (a let over compile-time constants — the message names the
  capture), a future that has not completed and a transient (both belong to a
  thread a restore does not have), a fn the runtime built rather than analyzed,
  and open resources with neither a handler nor stub mode. Use `scan` to find
  any of them without writing anything; `dump!` with {:unwritable :stub} writes
  placeholders instead of refusing."

  dump such objects as resolvable stubs instead."

;;
;; Code does not travel. A var whose root is a function is skipped, because the
;; restoring process is the same build and already has it — every `defn`,
;; protocol impl and multimethod is there before the image is read. Only data
;; moves, which is what keeps this affordable on a runtime with no heap dump.
