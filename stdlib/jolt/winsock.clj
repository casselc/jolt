;; jolt.winsock — Winsock initialization, once per process.
;;
;; On Windows a socket call before WSAStartup fails, and there is nothing in the
;; failure that says so: socket() answers INVALID_SOCKET and getaddrinfo answers
;; "unknown host", which read as an unusable machine rather than an uninitialized
;; library. jolt had solved this twice already — jolt.nrepl and jolt.mvn-http each
;; carried their own copy, which is why Maven resolution and nREPL worked on
;; Windows while every java.net socket did not (jolt-lang/jolt#1107).
;;
;; One copy, in a namespace that depends on nothing but jolt.ffi, so the deps
;; resolver can reach it without pulling in the java.net shim.
;;
;; Two things the copies had to know and a third caller would have had to
;; rediscover:
;;
;;   - ws2_32 must be dlopened BY NAME. Its symbols are not in jolt.exe's export
;;     table even though -lws2_32 is linked, so the process handle alone does not
;;     resolve socket(), and a jolt.ffi binding to one fails with "no entry".
;;   - WSADATA is ~400 bytes on x64 and WSAStartup writes the whole struct, so the
;;     buffer has to be generous; 512 is.
;;
;; WSAStartup is reference-counted and calling it twice is harmless, but it is a
;; foreign call and a library load per call, so the work is behind a delay: every
;; entry point can say `(ensure!)` on the way in without thinking about it.
